   abstract = {Denna uppsats syftar till att undersöka om och hur undervisning är anpassad eller differentierad baserat på antagandet att elever är varierade och lär på olika sätt samt hur lärares praktik förhåller sig till samtida forskning på området. Uppsatsen undersöker vidare huruvida specifika anpassningar relaterar till ökad delaktighet hos elever. Metoden för uppsatsen är en observationsstudie med fenomenologisk ansats. Den innefattar 30 olika lärare under 30 lektioner på en gymnasieskola i Sverige, där majoriteten av eleverna har en diagnos inom neuropsykiatriska spektrumet. Materialet bearbetades kvantitativt i SPSS Studien visar att sambandet mellan olika anpassningar och dess koppling mot delaktighet är komplext och påverkas av ett antal olika faktorer och förutsättningar. Det framgår att lärare i högre grad använder sig av vissa anpassningsformer och att andra förekommer mer sällan. Vanligt förekommande är beröm, att erbjuda alternativ för perception, aktivera förkunskaper tydliggörande av begrepp och tydliggöra centrala begrepp. Mindre förekommande faktorer var differentiering av uppgifter, synlig struktur, formativ bedömning, kamratlärande, elevinflytande och självvärdering. Uppsatsen kommer vidare att utgöra en grund för kollegialt lärande på skolan då fördjupad kunskap om hur lärare kan anpassa och differentiera undervisningen påverkar elevers lärande. },

   abstract = {Wireless local area networks (WLANs) deployment is increasing rapidly. At the same time, WLANs have become an attractive target for many potential attackers. In spite of that, the de facto standard used to implement most WLANs (IEEE 802.11) has what appear to be residual vulnerabilities related to identity spoofing. In this paper, a pragmatic study of two common attacks on the standard is conducted. These attacks are then implemented on test beds to learn attack behavior. Finally, novel attack signatures and techniques to detect these attacks are devised and implemented in a proof of concept Wireless Intrusion Detection System (WIDS). },

   abstract = {Accident models and analysis methods affect what accident investigators look for, which contributory factors are found, and which recommendations are issued. This paper contrasts the Sequentially Timed Events Plotting (STEP) method and the Functional Resonance Analysis Method (FRAM) for accident analysis and modelling. The main issue addressed in this paper is the comparison of the established multi-linear method STEP with the new systemic method FRAM and which new insights the latter provides for accident analysis in comparison to the former established multi-linear method. Since STEP and FRAM are based on a different understandings of the nature of accidents, the comparison of the methods focuses on what we can learn from both methods, how, when, and why to apply them. The main finding is that STEP helps to illustrate what happened, involving which actors at what time, whereas FRAM illustrates the dynamic interactions within socio-technical systems and lets the analyst understand the how and why by describing non-linear dependencies, performance conditions, variability, and their resonance across functions. },
