   abstract = {A Mobile ad hoc network is a collection of wireless nodes that dynamically organize themselves to form a network without the need for any fixed infrastructure or centralized administration. The network topology dynamically changes frequently in an unpredictable manner since nodes are free to move. Support for multicasting is essential in such environment as it is considered to be an efficient way to deliver information from source nodes to many client nodes. A problem with multicast routing algorithms is their efficiency as their forwarding structure determines the overall network resource consumption makes them significantly less efficient than unicast routing algorithms. In this research, we improve the performance of the popular ODMRP multicast routing protocol by restricting the domain of join query packets, which have been lost. This is achieved by augmenting the join query packets with minimum extra information (one field), which denotes the number of the visited node from previous forwarding group. Simulation results show, that our mechanisms significantly reduce the control traffic and thus the overall latency and power consumption in the network. },

Uppsatsen unders�ker vidare huruvida specifika anpassningar relaterar till �kad delaktighet hos elever. Metoden f�r uppsatsen �r en observationsstudie med fenomenologisk ansats. Den innefattar 30 olika l�rare under 30 lektioner p� en gymnasieskola i Sverige, d�r majoriteten av eleverna har en diagnos inom neuropsykiatriska spektrumet. Materialet bearbetades kvantitativt i SPSS Studien visar att sambandet mellan olika anpassningar och dess koppling mot delaktighet �r komplext och p�verkas av ett antal olika faktorer och f�ruts�ttningar. Det framg�r att l�rare i h�gre grad anv�nder sig av vissa anpassningsformer och att andra f�rekommer mer s�llan. Vanligt f�rekommande �r ber�m, att erbjuda alternativ f�r perception, aktivera f�rkunskaper tydligg�rande av begrepp och tydligg�ra centrala begrepp. Mindre f�rekommande faktorer var differentiering av uppgifter, synlig struktur, formativ bed�mning, kamratl�rande, elevinflytande och sj�lvv�rdering.

   abstract = {Wireless local area networks (WLANs) deployment is increasing rapidly. At the same time, WLANs have become an attractive target for many potential attackers. In spite of that, the de facto standard used to implement most WLANs (IEEE 802.11) has what appear to be residual vulnerabilities related to identity spoofing. In this paper, a pragmatic study of two common attacks on the standard is conducted. These attacks are then implemented on test beds to learn attack behavior. Finally, novel attack signatures and techniques to detect these attacks are devised and implemented in a proof of concept Wireless Intrusion Detection System (WIDS). },

   abstract = {Accident models and analysis methods affect what accident investigators look for, which contributory factors are found, and which recommendations are issued. This paper contrasts the Sequentially Timed Events Plotting (STEP) method and the Functional Resonance Analysis Method (FRAM) for accident analysis and modelling. The main issue addressed in this paper is the comparison of the established multi-linear method STEP with the new systemic method FRAM and which new insights the latter provides for accident analysis in comparison to the former established multi-linear method. Since STEP and FRAM are based on a different understandings of the nature of accidents, the comparison of the methods focuses on what we can learn from both methods, how, when, and why to apply them. The main finding is that STEP helps to illustrate what happened, involving which actors at what time, whereas FRAM illustrates the dynamic interactions within socio-technical systems and lets the analyst understand the how and why by describing non-linear dependencies, performance conditions, variability, and their resonance across functions. },
