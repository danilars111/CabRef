   abstract = {Accident models and analysis methods affect what accident investigators look for, which contributory factors are found, and which recommendations are issued. This paper contrasts the Sequentially Timed Events Plotting (STEP) method and the Functional Resonance Analysis Method (FRAM) for accident analysis and modelling. The main issue addressed in this paper is the comparison of the established multi-linear method STEP with the new systemic method FRAM and which new insights the latter provides for accident analysis in comparison to the former established multi-linear method. Since STEP and FRAM are based on a different understandings of the nature of accidents, the comparison of the methods focuses on what we can learn from both methods, how, when, and why to apply them. The main finding is that STEP helps to illustrate what happened, involving which actors at what time, whereas FRAM illustrates the dynamic interactions within socio-technical systems and lets the analyst understand the how and why by describing non-linear dependencies, performance conditions, variability, and their resonance across functions. },

   abstract = {Electricity usage by a household dishwasher can be reduced by using a heat pump system to heat the dishwasher cabinet, dishware and washing water. The evaporator obtains the energy from an energy storage unit which consists of a container filled with water which freezes to ice. The majority of the heat transfer from the energy storage to the evaporator occurs when ice is created in the energy storage unit. A transient simulation model of a dishwasher with a heat pump system was developed and compared to an experimental setup with good agreement. A simulation study of the compressor cylinder volume and the compressor operating time was performed. The results showed a 24% reduction in total electricity use compared to a dishwasher cycle using a traditional electric element. },

   abstract = {The world of online news is a world where news consumers must make choices among a plethora of different news sources. Previous research points towards a fragmentation of news consumption across the citizenry. However, not enough attention has been paid to class, in particular cultural capital, and how it shapes how groups in society develop preferences for different categories of online news. Drawing upon a representative national survey in Sweden (N = 11,108), a country historically known for its egalitarian news consumption, we show that cultural capital engenders patterns of taste and distaste for different online national news providers. This is manifested in that those rich in cultural capital are more inclined to consume ‘quality’ news and to neglect ‘popular’ news. A relative lack of cultural capital is associated with a somewhat reverse pattern. News consumption in the online media landscape is a matter of cultural distinction. },

In this study, we developed an approach for predicting the retention time shifts due to these gradients. The approach is presented as a step-by-step procedure and it is based on empirical linear relationships describing how retention varies as a function of temperature and pressure and how the average column temperature increases with the flow rate. It requires only four experiments on standard equipment, is based on straightforward calculations, and is therefore easy to use in method development. The approach was rigorously validated against experimental data obtained with a quality control method for the active pharmaceutical ingredient omeprazole. The accuracy of retention time predictions was very good with relative errors always less than 1% and in many cases around 0.5% (n = 32). Selectivity shifts observed between omeprazole and the related impurities when changing the flow rate could also be accurately predicted resulting in good estimates of the resolution between critical peak pairs. The approximations which the presented approach are based on were all justified. The retention factor as a function of pressure and temperature was studied in an experimental design while the temperature distribution in the column was obtained by solving the fundamental heat and mass balance equations for the different experimental conditions. We strongly believe that this approach is sufficiently accurate and experimentally feasible for this separation to be a valuable tool when developing a UHPLC method. After further validation with other separation systems, it could become a useful approach in UHPLC method development, especially in the pharmaceutical industry where demands are high for robustness and regulatory oversight. },

   abstract = {Quality Control methods (QC-methods) play an important role in the overall control strategy for drug manufacturing. However, efficient life-cycle management and continual improvement are hindered due to a variety of post-approval variation legislations across territories and a lack of harmonization of the requirements. As a result, many QC-methods fall behind the technical development. Developing the QC-method in accordance with the Quality by Design guidelines gives the possibility to do continual improvements inside the original Method Operable Design Region (MODR). However, often it is necessary to do changes outside the MODR, e.g. to incorporate new technology that was not available at the time the original method was development. Here, we present a method enhancement concept which allows minor adjustments, within the same measuring principle, outside the original MODR without interaction with regulatory agencies. The feasibility of the concept is illustrated by a case study of a QC-method based on HPLC, assumed to be developed before the introduction of UHPLC, where the switch from HPLC to UHPLC is necessary as a continual improvement strategy. The concept relies on the assumption that the System Suitability Test (SST) and failure modes are relevant for other conditions outside the MODR as well when the same measuring principle is used. It follows that it should be possible to move outside the MODR as long as the SST has passed. All minor modifications of the original, approved QC-method must be re-validated according to a template given in the original submission and a statistical equivalence should be shown between the original and modified QC-methods. To summarize, revalidation is handled within the pharmaceutical quality control system according to internal change control procedures, but without interaction with regulating agencies. },

   keywords = {pornography; feminism; american literature; andrea dworkin},
   abstract = {This essay argues that Andrea Dworkin’s much derided argument against pornography may still prove productive if read in relation to her fiction. Taking note of the fact that Dworkin’s own novels have been accused of being pornographic according to her criteria, the essay explores the possibility that her radical feminist anti-porn stance, inevitably described as something of a moralistic backlash by sex-liberals, could be seen as a continuation of the pornographic imagination it so vehemently protests. Through critical readings of Dworkin’s novels Ice and Fire and Mercy, as well as her autobiographical works and theoretical writings on pornography, the essay demonstrates that the contradic- tions that beset her writings echo the contradictions inherent in our contemporary under- standing of pornography. Much like the pornography she would resist, Dworkin’s writings invite a solipsistic mode of reading, the experiential rewards of which are not so much of an interpretive as of a sensual nature. In so doing, Dworkin’s fiction paradoxically proves an invaluable point of entry into the pornographic imagination, making evident its essentially monologic nature. While this circumstance may be damaging for her status as an agitator, it points to her continued—if as yet largely unacknowledged—importance as a writer.  },

   abstract = {Much of the sociolinguistic and stylistic variation which is of interest to linguists is phonetic in nature, but the access route to corpus data is typically via a textual transcription. This poses a significant problem for a researcher who wishes to access the original recordings of speech in order to analyse variation: how can they search for relevant data? Many transcription traditions allow for the representation of such variation through non-standard orthography, and such conventions should therefore allow access to data relevant to the study of variation. However, the specific conventions used vary between traditions (and indeed may not be applied consistently by individual transcribers). This then creates another problem where the researcher wishes to access data across an aggregated collection, which is a practical necessity given the relatively limited size of most corpora of spoken language. In this paper, we analyse the conventions used in two of the component collections in the Australian National Corpus, the Australian Radio Talkback Corpus and the Monash Corpus of Spoken English. On the basis of this analysis, we develop a fragment of an ontology which gives an explicit account of the phenomena related to non-standard pronunciation represented in the transcripts and which can therefore act as the basis for better searching of the collections and better access to relevant data for analysing sociolinguistic and stylistic variation. },

   abstract = {Advance care planning (ACP) is an international concept for improving patient autonomy and communication in the context of anticipated deterioration and end-of-life care. In a preparatory conversation, health care professionals facilitate one or more conversations where nursing home residents are invited to reflect on, and articulate wishes and preferences concerning future medical treatment and end-of-life care. Our aim with this study was to increase knowledge of existing ACP practices in Norwegian nursing homes. We wanted to know how nursing home residents, relatives and nursing home staff take part in the conversations, and to what extent these conversations can be regarded as promoting autonomy, legal rights and individual needs for the residents. We conducted participant observation of seven preparatory conversations, followed by interviews with health care staff (together) and resident and relative (together). In the result section, we present an informative case example of an ACP conversation where common and important characteristics running through our data are present. These are further elaborated under the following headings: Life critical questions, Residents' quiet participation in the conversations, the Dying phase a clinical issue, Nurses and physicians; different domains and Timing. We find that nursing home staff in our study wants to contribute to open awareness, autonomy and a good death, but there are little reflections about the purpose and content of the conversations, how they should be carried out and when, and what frail nursing home residents are able to understand and express in ACP conversations.  },

   abstract = {While the arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbiosis is known to be widespread in terrestrial ecosystems, there is growing evidence that aquatic plants also form the symbiosis. It has been suggested that symbiosis with AM fungi may represent an important adaptation for isoA &lt;&lt; tid plants growing on nutrient-poor sediments in oligotrophic lakes. In this study, we address AM fungal root colonization intensity, richness and community composition (based on small subunit (SSU) ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequencing) in five populations of the isoA &lt;&lt; tid plant species Lobelia dortmanna inhabiting oligotrophic lakes in Southern Sweden. We found that the roots of L. dortmanna hosted rich AM fungal communities and about 15 % of the detected molecular taxa were previously unrecorded. AM fungal root colonization intensity and taxon richness varied along an environmental gradient, being higher in oligotrophic and lower in mesotrophic lakes. The overall phylogenetic structure of this aquatic fungal community differed from that described in terrestrial systems: The roots of L. dortmanna hosted more Archaeosporaceae and fewer Glomeraceae taxa than would be expected based on global data from terrestrial AM fungal communities. },

   abstract = {The purpose of a barrier coating in food packaging is primarily to increase the shelf life of the foodstuff contained within the packaging, preserve its colour, odour, taste and quality, and thereby reduce food wastage (both at retail outlets and households). While most publications hitherto have compared packaging and barrier-coating materials on the basis of their environmental impacts alone, this paper adopts a more holistic approach by factoring in the economic aspect as well. Four barrier material alternatives - Starch, polyethylene, EVOH+kaolin, and latex+kaolin are analysed. Two well-defined end-of-life handling scenarios, relevant to Sweden, are considered - one in which everything except starch is recycled, with starch being composted, and the other in which everything is incinerated. Among the several environmental impact categories which can be analysed, this paper considers only global warming. Two approaches are tested to combine the economic and environmental aspects - normalisation, weighting and aggregating on the one hand, and using the carbon tax to internalize the externality caused by GHG emissions on the other. For the set of weighting factors obtained thanks to a survey conducted by the authors (40.6% for environmental and 59.4% for economic), starch emerges as the most sustainable alternative, followed by polyethylene for both the end-of-life handling scenarios. This tallies with the result obtained by using the carbon tax for internalization of the externality. The case study, methodology and results presented in this paper, will hopefully be a springboard for more detailed studies of this nature, under the umbrella of sustainability },

   abstract = {The following experiment describes an easy experiment for children 11-12 years old, performed during spring in a compulsory school near Karlstad, Sweden. Four different ripe fruits were placed under flowering plants of LL (Impatiens hawkeri) on a table and with plastic bags around both plants and fruits for four days. Two of these fruits produce ethylene to a high degree in connection with ripening, two do not. For one of these high-grade ethylene-producing fruits, apple, the result was very clear. The plants under influence of apple shed many flowers and buds already the first day, due to stimulated senescence caused by ethylene. For the other ethylene-producing fruit, kiwi fruit, the result was clear but not over-explicit as for apple. The other two fruits, orange and lemon, caused flowers and buds to shed in the same proportion as the control plants. From the result a discussion could involve tips of how to stimulate ripening of unripe fruits e.g. by putting apples in the same fruit dish as unripe fruits. Not all unripe fruits, however, will respond to this treatment. Another consequence is not to put flowering plants near ethylene-producing fruits. The experiment is planned in a correct scientific way and thus stimulates discussion about how to design experiments. Other advantages with the experiment are: almost no materials are necessary except pot-plants and fruits which are easy to buy in a garden centre and a grocers shop, the experiment is cheap, it is easy to perform and it stimulates practical work },

Drivande i den fortsatta utvecklingen var fackföreningsrörelsen. Kulmen nåddes 1990 då försäkringen fått en för de skadade mycket generös utformning. Arbetsgivarna var fram till 1990 på defensiven, men efter krispolitiken i början av 1990-talet kom de att verka för en försäkring som hade stor likhet med deras uppfattning på 1910-talet. },

In addition, estimates of the homogeneity of treatment effects appear to differ, thus suggesting that inferences of causes of the effectiveness of a TFP vary with research design.},

   keywords = {Substance displacement; Novel psychoactive substances; Legal highs; Drug abuse; Addiction},
   abstract = {Several hundred new synthetic drugs, novel psychoactive substances (NPS) or “legal highs�? have in recent years appeared on the drug market. These can effortlessly be obtained from on-line vendors, offering an easy access to a plethora of new and untested substances, often with unknown or dangerous effects. Several different attempts to reduce the availability of NPS and to prevent accidents and fatalities have been applied by governments around the world. Nonetheless this complex and constantly evolving situation provides palpable dilemmas and challenges to legislators and prevention strategists. One unintended consequence from prohibition and current drug policies occurs when possibly more precarious substances are used to substitute older and more well-known illicit drugs; so called “substance displacement�?. We have performed extensive research on the use of NPS, by analyzing Internet resources (drug discussion forum, on-line questionnaires), and published several NPS studies. During our research we observed how substance displacement is a common issue, with implications for both clinical practices, drug prevention strategies, as well as for legislators. In the present review we discuss two common themes of substance displacement: 1) Synthetic cannabinoids replace herbal cannabis, and 2) Different attempts for self-medication using NPS. Incitements for substance displacement, that exposes the user to possibly more harmful substances, are founded both in legislation (availability of substances and fear of legal repercussions) as well as from certain policies or cultural perceptions of various medical conditions. We offer no obvious solutions to these complications, but would like to contribute to awareness of how these factors effects drug users and how measures intended to reduce harm in many cases have the opposite effects. Further studies on the divergent motivations and different groups of NPS users are highlighted as imperative to find new and realistic solutions going forward.  },

   abstract = {Objective The objective was to investigate relationships between adolescent sleep disturbance and various worry themes. Methods Questionnaire data from 8 cross-sectional collections between 1988 and 2011 were used. The sample included more than 20,000 adolescents aged 15-16. Binary logistic regressions were used for the analyses. Results Sleep disturbance and female sex increased the odds of worrying about all themes. Sleep disturbance shared stronger associations with worry about financial security, accidents/illness, being bullied, and terrorist attacks (odds ratios, 2.65-3.35) compared with worry about environmental destruction or nuclear war (odds ratios, 1.73-2.11). No interactions between sleep and year of investigation were found. Conclusions Little is known about the association between adolescent worry and sleep, and about sleep disturbance and specific worry content. This study shows that the strength in the relationship between adolescent worry and sleep varies with worry themes. Knowledge of the worry content related to sleep may aid in targeting preventions and interventions. },

Syftet med artikeln är att presentera alternativa berättelser och att nyansera den stereotypa bilden av skolpojken som ointresserad av skolan och fångad i en maskulin kultur dominerad av styrka, tävling, rangordnande och motstånd.

Utifrån kritisk diskursteori och queerteori analyseras och diskuteras hur maskulinitet och könspositioner produceras i relation till undervisningens organisation och olika lektionspraktiker. Artikeln avslutar med att konstatera att det finns en mängd sätt för pojkar att vara i skolan som inte ansluter till den stereotypa bilden av skolpojken, eller som självklart kopplats till eller artikulerats som maskulinitet.

   abstract = {The article aims at studying game violence from an “awry�? perspective, i.e. in terms of how games deal with the violence against animals inherent in processes of producing and consuming meat. Rockstar’s notorious Manhunt (2003) is taken as an initial example of how violence in games is usually dealt with. I argue that the focus on gruesome imagery serves an ideological function by hiding the real material violence of the game industry. As an alternative, I suggest that we focus on how games make visible systemic, yet less palpable, forms of ideological violence. My main focus is on how three contemporary open-world games represent the relation between eating meat and the industrial killing of animals.           Three basic conceptual perspectives are combined: Slavoj Žižek’s distinction between subjective and objective violence; Melanie Joy’s conceptualization of cultural carnism as a cognitive scheme; and Ian Bogost’s procedural-rhetorical approach to videogames as models of material processes. These are employed in order to analyze three games taking a varied approach to the representation of meat as food: Rockstar’s Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas (2004), which includes a discursive critique of factory farming without also implementing it as a gameplay mechanic; Lionhead’s Fable II (2008), which implements ethical and political incentives for vegetarianism in the core mechanics of the game, yet allows for varied approaches in role-playing; and Maxis’ The Sims 3 (2009), which seems to include such incentives yet undermines them by dislodging food from its material origin in its model of the game world. },

An Australian team has participated in the International Linguistics Olympiad (IOL) every year since 2009. This paper describes how the competition is run (with a regional first round and a final national round) and the organisation of the competition (a National Steering Committee and Local Organising Committees for each region) and discusses the particular challenges faced by Australia (timing of the competition and distance between the major population centres). One major factor in the growth and success of OzCLO has been the introduction of the online competition, allowing participation of students from rural and remote country areas. The organisation relies on the goodwill and volunteer work of university and school staff but the strong interest amongst students and teachers shows that OzCLO is responding to a demand for linguistic challenges.

   abstract = {Despite its post-Soviet history, Azerbaijan is an under-investigated country in academic research—compared with the other former constituencies, such as the Baltic countries or Russia, of the USSR—and gender questions of the contemporary Azerbaijani society are even less touched on. Within the current context of the post-“Arab Spring�? era of mediatized connectivity and collective political engagement, this article looks into and analyzes how Azerbaijani women participate in different online and offline social and political movements, and if (and how) they are impeded by the increased state authoritarianism in Azerbaijan. Using data, obtained from online information resources, yearly reports of human rights organizations, focus group discussions, and interviews, the study detects four major activist constellations within the Azerbaijani field of gendered politics. Based on the analysis of conditions of detected groups, the article claims that flash mobs, a tactic employed mainly by liberal activists, emerge as the promising way in overcoming the normative nature of Azerbaijani patriarchal society, thus providing an opportunity for normalization and internalization of the feeling of being on the street and acting in concert with others—the practices which might lead towards an increasing participation of (especially young) women in the political processes of the country. },

   abstract = {We consider some extensions of the classical discrete Boltzmann equation to the cases of multicomponent mixtures, polyatomic molecules (with a finite number of different internal energies), and chemical reactions, but also general discrete quantum kinetic Boltzmann-like equations; discrete versions of the Nordheim-Boltzmann (or Uehling-Uhlenbeck) equation for bosons and fermions and a kinetic equation for excitations in a Bose gas interacting witha Bose-Einstein condensate. In each case we have an H-theorem and so for the planar stationary half-space problem, we have convergence to an equilibrium distribution at infinity (or at least a manifold of equilibrium distributions). In particular, we consider the nonlinear half-space problem of condensation and evaporation for these discrete Boltzmann-like equations. We assume that the flow tends to a stationary point at infinity and that the outgoing flow is known at the wall, maybe also partly linearly depending on the incoming flow. We find that the systems we obtain are of similar structures as for the classical discrete Boltzmann equation (for single species), and that previously obtained results for the discrete Boltzmann equation can be applied after being generalized. Then the number of conditions on the assigned data at the wall needed for existence of a unique solution is found. The number of parameters to be specified in the boundary conditions depends on if we have subsonic or supersonic condensation or evaporation. All our results are valid for any finite number of velocities. },

   abstract = {Our aim was to investigate the epidemiology of burned patients admitted to hospitals in Sweden, and to examine temporal trends during the last three decades. Our hypothesis was that there has been an appreciable decline in the number of patients admitted. Retrospective data about burned patients treated at Swedish hospitals 1987 - 2010 were obtained from the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare. Patients with primary or secondary ICD diagnoses of burns were included, reviewed and statistically interpreted in terms of sex, age, incidence, mortality in hospital and duration of stay. A total of 30,478 patients were admitted to hospitals with burns. The absolute number of admissions declined by 42% (95% CI 39 to 44). There was a highly significant reduction of 45% (95% CI: 38 to 51) in the ageadjusted incidence (admissions/million population) over the years, and the reduction was significant for both sexes. Children aged 0-4 years (n=8308) were most likely to be admitted to hospital (27%). The median duration of stay shortened over time (p &lt; 0.0001). There was an overall significant reduction in deaths at hospital/100 admissions over time (p &lt;0.0001). We think that the improvements are the result of a combination of preventive measures, improved treatments and greater use of outpatient facilities. If we understand these trends and the relations between age-adjusted incidence and actual number of admissions, we can gain insight into what is needed for future provision of emergency health care. },

The combination of pupils’ proven experiences and the leisure-time teachers’ reflective and researching approach proved to be the best route to follow in increasing the quality of the leisure-time centres. The leisure-time centres involved, to a greater extent than before the project, are now built upon a scientific approach as well as the proven experiences of both the pupils and the leisure-time teachers. The project underlines the well-known facts that developmental work needs stability and continuity to lay the foundation for sustainable change and that changes need to be a clear part of the schools’ development organization. },

   abstract = {The flow resistance in 3-dimensional fibrous structures are investigated in particle Reynolds number representing flow characteristics with strong inertia. The resistance coefficients are established based on steady state simulations of single-phase processes of water numerically. An automatized simulation process in COMSOL is developed with a MATLAB algorithm in which production runs could be carried for various 3-dimensional fibrous structures. Simulation of flow processes ranging from Reynolds numbers at creeping flow levels to high Reynolds number at approximately 1000 are calculated and a numerical data set is established in order to estimate Forchheimer coefficients which are used to correlate a dimensionless friction factor to a modified Reynolds expression for porous media. The friction factor and dimensionless permeability are calculated for fibrous structures with (i) disordered unidirectional fibers (ii) an isotropic fiber orientation in-plane perpendicular to the flow, and (iii) an isotropic fiber structure in a the 3-dimensional space. Empirical correlations of the friction factor and Reynolds number are used to compare our simulation data in order to assess the validity of our models and flow resistance estimations. The dimensionless permeability is moreover compared to other numerical simulations of flow through fibrous structures in order to assess flow resistance at low Reynolds number. It is concluded that flow resistance in the isotropic fiber arrangement in space is lower than the in-plane isotropic orientation and disordered unidirectional fiber arrangements at creeping flow conditions, however, all friction actors converges towards the same value at higher Reynolds numbers indicating that fiber orientation is independent at high inertia flow regimes. Overall, our numerical simulations agree well to classical empirical formulations for a wide range of Reynolds number. However, the comparison differs considerably depending on the porosity level. },

   abstract = {Background: Clinical group supervision has existed for over 20 years in nursing. However, there is a lack of studies about the role of supervision in nursing students' education and especially the focus on ethical reasoning. Aim: The aim of this study was to explore and describe nursing students' ethical reasoning and their supervisors' experiences related to participation in clinical group supervision. Research design: The study is a qualitative interview study with interpretative description as an analysis approach. Participants and research context: A total of 17 interviews were conducted with nursing students (n = 12) who had participated in clinical group supervision in their first year of nursing education, and with their supervisors (n = 5). Ethical considerations: The study was based on the ethical principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki, and permission was obtained from the Regional Ethical Review Board in Sweden. Findings: The analysis revealed that both the form and content of clinical group supervision stimulated reflection and discussion of handling of situations with ethical aspects. Unethical situations were identified, and the process uncovered underlying caring actions. Discussion and conclusion: Clinical group supervision is a model that can be used in nursing education to train ethical reflection and to develop an ethical competence among nursing students. Outcomes from the model could also improve nursing education itself, as well as healthcare organizations, in terms of reducing moral blindness and unethical nursing practice. },

   abstract = {PREMISE OF THE STUDY: Vegetative reproduction and spread through clonal growth plays an important role in arctic-alpine ecosystems with short cool growing seasons. Local variation in winter snow accumulation leads to discrete habitat types that may provide divergent conditions for sexual and vegetative reproduction. Therefore, we studied variation in clonal structure of a dominant, evergreen, dwarf shrub (Empetrum nigrum s.l. with the two taxa E. nigrum L. s.s. and E. hermaphroditum Hagerup) along a snow cover gradient and compared clonal diversity and spatial genetic structure between habitats. METHODS: We studied 374 individual shoots using 105 polymorphic AFLP markers and analyses based on hierarchical clustering, clonal diversity indices, and small-scale spatial genetic structure with pairwise kinship coefficient. We used two approaches to define a threshold of genotypic distance between two samples that are considered the same clone. Clonality was examined among three habitats (exposed ridges, sheltered depressions, birch forest) differing in snow conditions replicated in four study regions in Norway and Sweden. KEY RESULTS: Clonality of E. hermaphroditum differed between habitats with an increase in clonal diversity with decreasing snow depth. Small-scale spatial genetic structure increased with decreasing clonal diversity and increasing clone size. In three study regions, E. hermaphroditum was the only species, whereas in one region E. nigrum also occurred, largely confined to exposed ridges. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrated that snow cover in conjunction with associated habitat conditions plays an important role for the mode of propagation of the dwarf shrub E. hermaphroditum. },

Results highlight that while positive interactions with medical staff (doctors) lead to increased well-being through engaging in coproducing treatment options, interactions with friends and family and their associated cocreated activities have an even greater positive effect on well-being. Furthermore, several other customer directed activities have positive indirect effects. Interestingly, activities requiring change can have a negative effect on well-being, except in psychological illnesses, where the opposite is true. The authors conclude with theoretical and managerial implications, highlighting that if interactions and activities with medical professionals are supplemented with customer-directed activities, the positive effect on well-being is significantly enhanced. },

Objective: The present feasibility study focuses on Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQOL) and life satisfaction of parents of children with chronic conditions. Method: The study was conducted using a repeated measures design and applied either group-based cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT; n = 10) or a group-based mindfulness programme (MF; n = 9). The study participants were wait-listed for six months. Results:The results indicate improvements for participants in both treatment groups regarding certain areas of HRQOL and life satisfaction. After eight group therapy sessions, parents in the two treatment groups significantly improved their Mental Component Summary (MCS) scores as well as their scores on the mental subscales Vitality, Social functioning, Role emotional and Mental health. In addition, some of the physical subscales, Role physical, Bodily pain and General health, showed considerable improvement for the MF group. When testing for clinical significance by comparing the samples with mean values of a norm population, the MCS scores were significantly lower at pre-measurements, but no significant differences were observed post-measurement. For the Physical component summary (PCS) scores, a significantly higher score was observed at post-measurement when compared to the norm population. Moreover, the results indicate improvement in life satisfaction regarding Spare time, Relation to child and Relation to partner. Conclusion: The study concludes that CBT and mindfulness may have a positive effect on areas of HRQOL and life satisfaction. },

From being considered secondary to primary psychiatric disorders, comorbid insomnia is now considered an independent health issue that warrants treatment in its own right. Cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is an evidence-based treatment for insomnia. The effects from CBT-I on comorbid psychiatric conditions have received increasing interest as insomnia comorbid with psychiatric disorders has been associated with more severe psychiatric symptomologies, and there are studies that indicate effects from CBT-I on both insomnia and psychiatric symptomology. During recent years, the literature on CBT-I for comorbid psychiatric groups has expanded and has advanced methodologically. This article reviews recent studies on the effects from CBT-I on sleep, daytime symptoms and function and psychiatric comorbidities for people with anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder, psychotic disorders and post-traumatic stress disorder.

   abstract = {We report the results of a simulation study in which we explore the joint effect of group absorptive capacity (as the average individual rationality of the group members) and cognitive distance (as the distance between the most rational group member and the rest of the group) on the emergence of collective rationality in groups. We start from empirical results reported in the literature on group rationality as collective group level competence and use data on real-life groups of four and five to validate a mathematical model. We then use this mathematical model to predict group level scores from a variety of possible group configurations (varying both in cognitive distance and average individual rationality). Our results show that both group competence and cognitive distance are necessary conditions for emergent group rationality. Group configurations, in which the groups become more rational than the most rational group member, are groups scoring low on cognitive distance and scoring high on absorptive capacity. },

   keywords = {HPLC, pH, Adsorption, Omeprazole},
   abstract = {The adsorption of the proton-pump inhibitor omeprazole was investigated using RP-LC with chemometric models combined with adsorption isotherm modelling to study the effect of pH and type of organic modifier (i.e., acetonitrile or methanol). The chemometric approach revealed that omeprazole was tailing with methanol and fronting with acetonitrile along with increased fronting at higher pH. The increased fronting with higher pH for acetonitrile was explored using a pH-dependent adsorption isotherm model that was determined using the inverse method and it agreed well with the experimental data. The model indicated that the peaks exhibit more fronting at high pH due to a larger fraction of charged omeprazole molecules. This model could accurately predict the shape of elution profiles at arbitrary pH levels in the studied interval. Using a two-layer adsorption isotherm model, the difference between acetonitrile and methanol was studied at the lowest pH at which almost all omeprazole molecules are neutral. Omeprazole had adsorbate–adsorbate interactions that were similar in strength for the acetonitrile and methanol mobile phases, while the solute–adsorbent interactions were almost twice as strong with methanol. The difference in the relative strengths of these two interactions likely explains the different peak asymmetries (i.e., tailing/fronting) in methanol and acetonitrile. In conclusion, thermodynamic modelling can complement chemometric modeling in HPLC method development and increase the understanding of the separation. },

The aim of the experimental concept study presented here was to evaluate a new drying method for a heat pump dishwasher. In this method, the drying of the dishware occurs as a fan circulates humid air in a closed system in which the water on the dishware evaporates inside the warm dishwasher cabinet and then condenses on a cold surface of the frozen water tank. The evaluation of drying performance was based on the European standard EN50242, which considers visible water drops left on the dishware after a completed dishwashing cycle. The results showed that this new closed drying method was more energy efficient compared to an existing open drying method, and that the drying start temperature and the drying time had a significant effect on the drying performance. Its lower electricity consumption and the fact that it does not vent humid air into the kitchen gives this heat pump dishwasher a competitive advantage over dishwashers using an open drying method. },

In addition, we detail how these two methods tackle content analysis pillars such as mode of analysis, sampling, sampling size, variable design, unit of analysis, measuring point(s), access/capture/storing, conclusions/generalizability and the key agent doing the actual work. We summarize the article by arguing that established content analysis is insufficient for digital media but that common standards, protocols and procedures are yet to be developed for these new approaches to digital journalism research. },

Drawing on quantitative and qualitative data for the construction sector, the article addresses three questions. How do employers balance their flexibility preferences in the context of regulatory constraints? How has the global recession influenced employer behaviour? And to what extent can the Swedish experience be explained by convergence on other country models? While the UK employment model encourages employers to externalise the risk of unpredictable market conditions through the use of contingent contracts, the more supportive welfare regime in Sweden underpins a resilient preference of employers for open-ended employment contracts. Ongoing changes in labour market regulation pose challenges to the strongly regulated Swedish model, yet we find only a shared direction of travel with the UK rather than convergence in the use of contingent employment. },

   abstract = {Objective: This paper analyzes how primary care physician visits are affected by the level of copayment in Sweden. Data source: We use data between the years 2003-2012 from 21 Swedish health care regions that have the mandate to set their own level of copayment. The copayment per visit varies between 10 and 20 for these years and regions. Study design: Our strategy to identify the causal effect and deal with unobserved endogeneity of price changes on physician visits is based on a panel data model using fixed effects to control for region and time and regional-variation in time trends. Principal finding: We cannot reject that the copayment has no statistical or economic effect of significance, and we estimate the "zero effect" with very high precision. Conclusion: In a setting with sub-national regions with autonomy to set copayments the results points to that the copayment is not an important predictor for the number of health care visits. The result is in line with some previous studies on European data where the range of copayments used tends to be relatively low.  },

In this study, utilization of such FB boilers for production of syngas in dual fluidized bed gasifiers and subsequent catalytic biofuel production to substitute natural gas (SNG), methanol (MeOH) and Fischer-Tropsch fuel (FT) has been examined. Based on the hypothesis that waste-heat and tail gas from the biofuel processes can be utilized in the CHP plant, process configurations aiming for operationally robustness and low investment cost rather than maximum stand-alone efficiency have been explored and implemented in actual industrial cases and over the full operating range of the boilers. The results of the study show that significant improvements of overall efficiency can be achieved by integration of the biofuel processes in the CHP plants and that a relatively high biofuel production capacity can be achieved. SNG showed the highest obtainable efficiency and production capacity of the studied biofuels, whereas the FT process showed largest increase in terms of efficiency when integrated in the CHP plant, compared to its stand-alone efficiency. },

The medium in question consists of a connected matrix with disconnected, initially periodically distributed inclusions separated by a sharp interface undergoing a priori known phase transformations. While such estimates seem not to be obtainable in the fully coupled setting, we show that for some simplified scenarios optimal convergence rates can be proven rigorously. The main technique for the proofs are energy estimates using special reconstructions of two-scale functions and particular operator estimates for periodic functions with zero average. Here, additional regularity results for the involved functions are necessary. },

Our continuous model consists of the continuity equation for the density of the crowd and a kinetic equation for the velocity field. The latter includes a nonlocal term that models interactions between individuals. To support our modelling assumptions, we introduce an inequality that resembles the Second Law of Thermodynamics, containing an entropy-like functional. We show that its time derivative equals a positive dissipation term minus a corrector term. The latter term should be small for the time derivative of the entropy to be positive. In case of isotropic interactions the corrector term is absent. For the anisotropic case, we support the claim that the corrector term is small by simulations for the corresponding particle system. They reveal that this term is sufficiently small for the entropy still to increase. Moreover, we show that the entropy converges in time towards a limit value. },

A model of recurrent updating of current mood is developed and compared to a model of how a sequence of events evoking emotional responses is evaluated retrospectively. In Experiment 1, 149 undergraduates are presented sequences of lottery outcomes with a fixed probability of losing or winning different amounts of money. Ratings of current mood are made after the sequence. Retrospective evaluations are either made after the ratings of current mood or, in a control condition, when no ratings of current mood are made. The results show an expected effect on current mood of the valence of the end of the sequence. The results are less clear in showing an expected beginning effect on the retrospective evaluations. An expected beginning effect on retrospective evaluations is found in Experiment 2 in which 41 undergraduates are first asked to remember the different amounts of money, then to evaluate the sequence as lottery outcomes. },

   abstract = {It is widely recognized that the Internet transport layer has become ossified, where further evolution has become hard or even impossible. This is a direct consequence of the ubiquitous deployment of middleboxes that hamper the deployment of new transports, aggravated further by the limited flexibility of the Application Programming Interface (API) typically presented to applications. To tackle this problem, a wide range of solutions have been proposed in the literature, each aiming to address a particular aspect. Yet, no single proposal has emerged that is able to enable evolution of the transport layer. In this work, after an overview of the main issues and reasons for transport-layer ossification, we survey proposed solutions and discuss their potential and limitations. The survey is divided into five parts, each covering a set of point solutions for a different facet of the problem space: 1) designing middlebox- proof transports, 2) signaling for facilitating middlebox traversal, 3) enhancing the API between the applications and the transport layer, 4) discovering and exploiting end-to-end capabilities, and 5) enabling user-space protocol stacks. Based on this analysis, we then identify further development needs towards an overall solution. We argue that the development of a comprehensive transport layer framework, able to facilitate the integration and cooperation of specialized solutions in an application-independent and flexible way, is a necessary step toward making the Internet transport architecture truly evolvable. To this end, we identify the requirements for such a framework and provide insights for its development.  },

   volume = {12},
   abstract = {2013 infördes en ny reform om karriärvägar för lärare. Genom att tillsätta 17 000 lärare i en ny position, en formellt högre befattning – förstelärare - förväntas reformen förutom att bidra till skolutveckling och förbättrad måluppfyllelse även att höja läraryrkets status. Efter reformens två första år konstateras att förstelärarpositionen domineras av kvinnor. I artikeln belyses de villkor som kvinnor i lärarkarriärer mött och fortfarande möter, villkor som relateras till de positioner som förstelärarna upplever sig ha. Data från intervjuer och enkäter belyser hur första generationens förstelärare själva upplever att lärarkollegor ser på deras nya position och hur de själva hanterar dessa bemötanden. I analysen av data har vi inspirerats av ett teoretiskt ramverk av Wahl, Holgersson och Höök (1998) om hur ironi och motstånd används för att hantera skilda positioner bland kollegor. Resultaten visar framförallt hur förstelärare utsätts för ironiska kommentarer och gliringar från kollegor, men även hur förstelärare gör motstånd och hävdar sin position.    Begreppet position används i artikeln i två betydelser. Å ena sidan refererar position till den formella befattningen som förstelärarna har fått genom förordnandet. Å andra sidan hänvisar positionsbegreppet till den symboliska plats som förstelärarna försätts och försätter sig själva i genom interaktion med andra i yrkesvardagens praktiker. },

   abstract = {The authors are developing anthropomorphic musical performance robots as an approach to understand the human motor control and to enhance the human-robot interaction from an engineering point of view. For this purpose; since 1990, we have developed an anthropomorphic flutist robot. As one of our long-term approaches, we aim to develop an anthropomorphic musical performance robot capable of playing different kinds of woodwind instruments, e.g. flute and saxophone. In this paper, the improvements of the mechanical design and sensing system of the Waseda Flutist Robot No. 4 Refined V (WF-4RV) are detailed. As for the sensing system, an array of sensors has been designed to detect the lip's pressure distribution. On the other hand, the lips and lung have been re-designed to enable the flutist robot to play the saxophone. },

   abstract = {Contemporary diplomacy is subject to the same pressures of globalization as many other communication industries. However, insights from different areas of Media and Communication Studies have only been partly explored in the context of diplomacy. This article applies theories of transmedia storytelling, transmedia engagement and surveillance upon a case study of the recent Campaign to End Sexual Violence in Conflict. The aim is to investigate the ways in which contemporary diplomatic advocacy campaigns cope with fundamental problems such as media repertoires, co-created content, collective intelligence, digital convergence and stakeholder management. The article contends that co-creation and co-option of shared values through transmedia engagement techniques perform a disciplining role for stakeholders that may be linked to theories of surveillance and biopolitics. This study will be of much relevance to those interested in the significance of participatory culture theories to contemporary international advocacy, including its policies, strategies and mediating practices. },

   abstract = {An important aspect of constructing discrete velocity models (DVMs) for the Boltzmann equation is to obtain the right number of collision invariants. It is a well-known fact that DVMs can also have extra collision invariants, so called spurious collision invariants, in plus to the physical ones. A DVM with only physical collision invariants, and so without spurious ones, is called normal. For binary mixtures also the concept of supernormal DVMs was introduced, meaning that in addition to the DVM being normal, the restriction of the DVM to any single species also is normal. Here we introduce generalizations of this concept to DVMs for multicomponent mixtures. We also present some general algorithms for constructing such models and give some concrete examples of such constructions. One of our main results is that for any given number of species, and any given rational mass ratios we can construct a supernormal DVM. The DVMs are constructed in such a way that for half-space problems, as the Milne and Kramers problems, but also nonlinear ones, we obtain similar structures as for the classical discrete Boltzmann equation for one species, and therefore we can apply obtained results for the classical Boltzmann equation. },

   abstract = {In 2010 and 2011 several political leaders in Europe took distance from the multicultural society model. The concept of cultural heritage has been central to this political debate. But this concept is also central in education and actively used both in the general part of the curriculum in Norway and also in the curricula of several subjects. This article examines how «cultural heritage» is defined and used in three central curricula: Norwegian, Religious Studies and Ethics (KRLE), and Social Sciences, at a macro level (subject’s purpose) and also at a micro level (learning outcomes). To analyze how this concept is used in these curricula is an important premise for being able to think critically about this concept within the classroom. It also creates a better prerequisite for understanding the extent to which these subjects are focusing on a more or less dynamic and inclusive understanding of identity, as well as a self-reflexive and critical skills development },

As a senior lecturer in plant physiology at University of Karlstad I have simplified experiments intended for students at university and then tested them on 10-11 year old pupils in compulsory school. Pupils have cultivated seedlings of peas in normal day/night conditions and in darkness during two school weeks. Differences in length, form of leaves and colours are striking and easy to explain. Besides these clear results the experiment has many advantages: it is easy to prepare and carry out, it requires very little equipment and it is cheap. The theory is simple and most important: it stimulates to further studies in biology },

ESD is mentioned in the geography curricula but without explanation and implementation.

   keywords = {Arrhenatheretalia, degradation of vegetation, grassland, Polish Sudetes Mts, species richness},
   abstract = {The degradation of species-rich mountain meadows has been observed in many parts of Central Europe in the last few decades. It is reflected in decreasing species numbers and changes in the proportions of plant species in the aboveground vegetation. Some species are increasing in abundance and eventually dominate the meadow vegetation. There is still a lack of studies explaining how this process is reflected in the soil seed bank. Therefore, the goal of the current study was to test whether expansive species that degrade aboveground vegetation of mountain meadows also influence, quantitatively and qualitatively, seed rain and seed bank. Soil samples were taken from 14 plots in degraded patches and another 14 plots in non-degraded patches. Nearly the same numbers of seedlings were recorded in both meadow types. In both cases, low similarities between aboveground vegetation and soil seed rain and seed bank were observed. Expansive species causing meadow degradation (Calamagrostis epigejos, Festuca rubra, Deschampsia cespitosa and Lupinus polyphyllus) reached cover values of 60-83% in the aboveground vegetation, and a share of up to 36% in the seed rain and seed bank. The mean species richness in the aboveground vegetation and the soil of degraded meadows was lower than in the non degraded plots. However, the seed bank may buffer degradation to some extent since the degradation of aboveground vegetation was faster than impoverishment of seed bank. Consequently, seed rain and seed bank of degraded meadows still contained typical mesic meadow species in similar proportions as non-degraded meadows. This indicates that seed rain and seed bank may contribute to the restoration of degraded meadows after the removal of expansive species from the aboveground vegetation. },

   abstract = {Fundamental diagrams describing the relation between pedestrians' speed and density are key points in understanding pedestrian dynamics. Experimental data evidence the onset of complex behaviors in which the velocity decreases with the density, and different logistic regimes are identified. This paper addresses the issue of pedestrian transport and of fundamental diagrams for a scenario involving the motion of pedestrians escaping from an obscure tunnel. We capture the effects of communication efficiency and exit capacity by means of two thresholds controlling the rate at which particles (walkers, pedestrians) move on the lattice. Using a particle system model, we show that in the absence of limitation in communication among pedestrians, we reproduce with good accuracy the standard fundamental diagrams, whose basic behaviors can be interpreted in terms of exit capacity limitation. When the effect of limited communication ability is considered, then interesting nonintuitive phenomena occur. In particular, we shed light on the loss of monotonicity of the typical speed-density curves, revealing the existence of a pedestrian density optimizing the escape. We study both the discrete particle dynamics and the corresponding hydrodynamic limit (a porous medium equation and a transport (continuity) equation). We also point out the dependence of the effective transport coefficients on the two thresholds---the essence of the microstructure information.Read More: http://epubs.siam.org/doi/10.1137/15M1030960 },

   abstract = {The purpose of this article is to explore the concept of availability, both empirically and theoretically, in the context of three Swedish organisations, and identifies the structural influences on availability patterns for work and family. Design/methodology/approach - The article is based on quantitative case studies using employer records and an employee questionnaire in three organisations. Multivariate descriptive statistics and multivariate logistic regression are used to illustrate and analyse patterns of availability for work and family. Findings - The descriptive data demonstrate the influence of the organisational context and type of production process, as well as gender, on availability patterns. Patterns of work availability appeared to differ across the organisations to a greater extent than patterns of family availability, which were highly gendered. The logistic regression results indicated that: occupation was a significant influence on both temporal and spatial availability patterns across the organisations; gender was the most significant influence on time spent on household work and part-time working for parents with young children; age of employees and age of employees' children were the most significant factors influencing the use of time off work for family. Research limitations/implications - Analysis limited to case studies. More extensive quantitative research would be needed to make empirical generalisations. Qualitative research would be needed to establish whether and how employees are able to make use of different availability patterns to improve their work-life balance. Originality/value - The concept of availability is a new way of trying to capture and analyse tensions in people's everyday lives as they try to manage multiple demands. },

   abstract = {Hur kommer det sig att tilltron till systematik och vetenskap är så stor i dagens utbildningssystem? Är det så att vetenskap likställds med säker och sann kunskap som kan användas för att komma till rätta med skolans aktuella problem och dilemman? Flera av de reformer som genomförts syftar till att få skolans professionella att inta ett mer vetenskapligt förhållningssätt vilket har bidragit till att intresset för praktikorienterade studier har ökat och att idag är allt fler lärare och rektorer aktiva aktörer i uppbyggnaden av den vetenskapliga forskningen. I arbetet med denna text konstaterar jag att det finns kopplingar att finna mellan den rådande diskursen om skolans vetenskaplighet och kraven på hög måluppfyllelse och goda elevresultat. I en tid då utbildningsnivå betraktas som ett viktigt konkurrensmedel hamnar stort fokus på skolans måluppfyllelse och elevernas resultat och på vilket sätt dessa kan förbättras snabbt och effektivt. Vad sker med undervisningen och skolans ledarskap i kölvattnet efter omvärldens ökade krav på vetenskap och systematik? I dag ligger makten och ansvaret för skolans utveckling till stor del på andra än på skolans professionella. Hur kan den maktbalansen förändras till fördel för lärare och rektorer? Slutligen har jag även reflekterat över hur denna utveckling legat till grund för mitt val av aktionsforskning som vetenskaplig ansats i det egna avhandlingsarbetet. },

   abstract = {The use of renewable resources for bioenergy should be performed to support sustainable development. Since the use of bioenergy has increased significantly worldwide in recent years and biomass is made of limited resources it must be used efficiently and with a low environmental impact The wood fuel pellet industry has the possibility to meet these criteria; however, it also has the potential for improvements. This work investigates how the additives, cornstarch and molasses, affect: the electricity consumption of the pellet press, the emission of Carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2 eq.) from the production of wood fuel pellets in three different countries with different emissions from electricity, the durability of the pellets and its effects on energy efficiency. The results show that pellet production is more energy efficient when additives are used, and that the amount of CO2 eq. increases with an increased use of additives. In countries with a low usage of fossil fuels for electricity production, the global warming impact gets higher due to the additives; while in countries that use a lot of fossil fuels to produce electricity, the global warming impact will be reduced because of the additives by up to 1%. The increased global warming impact from the additives can be balanced by the decrease in the reduced amount of rejected material within the production. That is because the durability of the pellets increases with an increasing amount of additive. },

A priori and a posteriori error estimates for the semi-discrete fields of active concentrations and for the position of the moving interface are obtained. The important feature of the system of partial differential equations is that the nonlinear coupling occurs due to the presence of both the moving boundary and the non-linearities of localized sinks and sources by reaction. },

Characterisations of knowledge contributions in subject didactics and RE are used as analytical tools while the study as a whole draws on socio-cultural perspectives on learning and activity theory which stress how learning takes place in the discursive practices where people are active. A striking similarity between the dissertations is that none of them has been developed in an in an RE discipline, with an RE supervisor, or in an academic milieu specialising in RE. The different academic contexts have contributed to interesting combinations and developments of theoretical perspectives but simultaneously there is a lack of milieus that deal with these findings and integrate them into further developmental processes. Moreover, there seem to be larger differences in RE knowledge contributions between the dissertations and the textbooks as groups than within these groups. While the dissertations represent empirical studies of the participants in the teaching practices and use the findings as foundations for discussions and problematisations of RE teaching, the student teacher texts take the RE content and curriculum for granted to a larger extent. One conclusion of this article is that in order to strengthen the RE field – both in school, teacher education and research – extended cooperation between these different practices is needed. },

   keywords = {actor-to-actor; value creation; service ecosystems; markets-as-practice; value co-creation practices; institutional work},
   abstract = {This article explores how seemingly distinct actors contribute to value creation and evaluation in a fundamentally similar way. It shows that the division of actors into dichotomies such as producers and consumers, paying and non-paying customers, and adopters and non-adopters, is based on narrow, unidirectional, transactional, and dyadic views on value creation and delivery. The article highlights the limitations of these views and draws on a service ecosystems perspective and its broader notion of co-created and contextual value to overcome these limitations. More specifically, the article, by connecting two frameworks (markets-as-practice and institutional work), extends a generic actor-to-actor conceptualization of value creation, in showing that all economic and social actors participate in value creation in a fundamentally similar way. That is, they enact value co-creation practices and simultaneously shape these practices by creating, maintaining and disrupting the institutions that guide their (re)enactment. Thus, the article proposes a unified view on actorsâ participation in value creation that not only points to the involvement of broader actor categories in value creation and market formation processes, but also provides important strategic implications in the form of a research agenda. },

   abstract = {Background: The aim of this study was to determine the influence of selected physiological, psychological and situational factors on experience of fatigue, and functional limitations due to fatigue in patients with stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Methods: In total 101 patients with COPD and 34 control patients were assessed for experience of fatigue, functional limitation due to fatigue (Fatigue Impact Scale), physiological [lung function, 6-minute walk distance (6MWD), body mass index (BMI), dyspnoea, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), surfactant protein D], psychological (anxiety, depression, insomnia), situational variables (age, sex, smoking, living alone, education), and quality of life. Results: Fatigue was more common in patients with COPD than in control patients (72% versus 56%, p &lt; 0.001). Patients with COPD and fatigue had lower lung function, shorter 6MWD, more dyspnoea, anxiety and depressive symptoms, and worse health status compared with patients without fatigue (all p &lt; 0.01). No differences were found for markers of systemic inflammation. In logistic regression, experience of fatigue was associated with depression [odds ratio (OR) 1.69, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.28-2.25) and insomnia (OR 1.75, 95% CI 1.19-2.54). In linear regression models, depression, surfactant protein D and dyspnoea explained 35% (R-2) of the variation in physical impact of fatigue. Current smoking and depression explained 33% (R-2) of the cognitive impact of fatigue. Depression and surfactant protein D explained 48% (R-2) of the psychosocial impact of fatigue. Conclusions: Experiences of fatigue and functional limitation due to fatigue seem to be related mainly to psychological but also to physiological influencing factors, with depressive symptoms, insomnia problems and dyspnoea as the most prominent factors. Systemic inflammation was not associated with perception of fatigue but surfactant protein D was connected to some dimensions of the impact of fatigue },

   abstract = {This study examines temporal trends in deaths due to fire-related accidents in Sweden from 1952 to 2013 based on statistics in the Cause of Death register held by the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare. Fatalities coded with underlying cause of death associated with fire-related accidents are included and absolute numbers and age-adjusted mortality rates are calculated and statistically analysed for trends using Poisson regression. The results show a significant reduction in both absolute numbers and in the age-adjusted mortality rate with a decline in absolute number of deaths of 34% over the period. However, the elderly population (80+ years) showed a significant increase in absolute numbers. Regarding the age-adjusted mortality rate, a significant reduction of 63% was observed and children aged 0 to 4 years showed the largest decrease (91%). A reduction was seen both in terms of fatalities due to burns and carbon monoxide poisoning, although the reduction was more pronounced with regards to burns (69% compared to 46%). Although an overall decrease was observed in both absolute numbers and in the age-adjusted mortality rate, with an aging population, the absolute numbers of fire-related deaths for the elderly population will most likely increase in the future. Therefore, whilst previously a child-injury issue, fire-related deaths in Sweden is now predominantly an issue of safety for the elderly. In combination with more deaths now being attributed to carbon monoxide poisoning, new preventative strategies may be required },

   abstract = {Risk assessments are important to ensure efficient and effective flood risk management. Methods and strategies for flood risk assessment are described in the literature, but less is known about how assessments are actually performed. We have studied local flood risk assessments in Sweden by interviewing flood risk managers in municipalities and analyzing documentation of flood risk assessment efforts. There is a large variation between municipalities in how flood risk assessment has been done. The efforts made in association with the EU Floods Directive together with a Government Commission about a flood in Lake Malaren are the most advanced assessments. Only a few of the municipalities have done comparable assessments. Generally, however, there is a lack of experience and theoretical knowledge about concepts and methods of flood risk assessment in the municipalities. In the assessments studied, the flood itself had been rather well defined in hazard maps. The consequences of a flood had been studied in the larger projects but only by half of the municipalities. It is mainly direct, tangible consequences that have been included. It is mainly the exposure of assets that has been investigated while little attention has been paid to vulnerability. To improve flood risk assessment in Sweden there is a need for knowledge and resources in the municipalities. Prioritization and motivation are needed to actually perform the assessments. National guidelines for may be helpful to guide municipalities in this work and to have more uniform risk assessment. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. },

This longitudinal analysis of Sweden’s four major mainstream national news websites focuses on front-page news items to investigate to what extent user participation has increased over time and whether the participatory features present allow users to exert control over key journalistic processes. Its findings indicate that user participation has increased rapidly in regard to processes peripheral to news journalism, but also that users have to a minor extent begun over time to perform work previously reserved for professional journalists. },

   abstract = {According to previous research, two characteristics of online news as opposed to traditional news are interactivity and immediacy. However, most research in this area has focused on the news site-level of analysis, and there are only a few studies on how interactivity and immediacy affect online news on the news story-level of analysis. The main reason for this appears to be that the very nature of online news makes observation by traditional research methods, such as quantitative content analysis, problematic. Against this background, the overall purpose of this paper is to explore methodological approaches for the study of interactivity and immediacy on the news story-level of online news. The paper develops a three-pronged strategy for freezing the flow of online news to enable systematic content analyses of interactivity and immediacy, and tests this strategy in a comparative analysis of the online news sites Guardian.co.uk in Britain and Aftonbladet.se in Sweden. },

   abstract = {In this article I investigate emancipatory spaces in masculinity studies with the guidance of Karen Barad's work, and in particular concepts such as diffraction and interference. For my purposes, Karen Barad's work opens up for understanding critical differences within regulated emotional spaces and stale relationalities of masculine gender configurations. Diffracted readings in masculinity studies could extend the symbolic space for acceptable forms of intimacy and possibly create emancipatory openings for hegemonic and dominant forms of lust communions. I argue that a sensual and conceptual key to alternative routes of masculine gendered subjectivities is intimacy and vulnerability. As such, vulnerability also connotes and produces a range of conceptual and embodied dyads and triads; empowered-disempowered; embodied-disembodied-ablebodied; homosocial-homoerotic-homosexual; potent-impotent; human-nonhuman; old-young, to mention a few. Vulnerability is also an onto-epistemological vantage point that hopefully and possibly could work our way around classical binaries and do a well-needed job as a form of emancipatory compass. },

   abstract = {This article examines and discusses how successful teachers develop professionally and relate this process to theory and practice. It elucidates some further aspects of an earlier longitudinal, praxis-oriented study in excellence that was carried out over a period of seven years in a nine-year Swedish compulsory school (Tjernberg, 2013). That case study was based on classroom observations and follow-up discussions to create consciousness of learning processes among the teachers and the researcher. According to the teachers in this study, the focus of pedagogical research is seldom on pedagogical practices, which means that they are not felt to be important. In contrast, the research is seen to be important if it has an inside perspective, using mutual and continuous communication between the pupils, themselves, and the researcher. One main finding is that a researcher can contribute to theorising and putting into words the teachers' pedagogical practices. At the same time, the researcher is able to deepen her or his research into issues that arise from the teachers' practices and knowledge. These two conditions are in turn necessary for the individual pupil to develop her or his proximal learning, which leads to further research questions. In this article, the term 'triple learning process' is used to describe this interaction. },

Research in the field of religious education in Iceland has been rather limited, and the question arises, what knowledge is available in that area in the country? All three projects reflect the development of Icelandic society from being relatively homogeneous in religious matters to growing secularization and increasing religious diversity and pluralism. Although their objectives are different, they clearly show how the development of the society affects emphases in the school’s religious education. Therefore their results and discussion provide a foundation of knowledge on religious education in compulsory schools in Iceland or other multicultural societies. In the first projects the historical development in Iceland is described and compared with the development in the other Nordic countries (Denmark, Norway and Sweden) and it effectively creates the background for the other projects. The development of Christian and religious education in Iceland is shaped by the development of the society. In the two other research projects the conclusion is that religious education must take into account the increasing diversity and put the students and their diverse experiences in focus. The emphasis is placed on the idea that the approach to religious education needs to be multicultural, precisely because there are students in the schools with different cultural and religious backgrounds and experiences. It is necessary to take this into account, since factors such as family, home and school affect each other. },

Up to one in six children in the western world experience physical or psychological neglect during their upbringing. Severe neglect is associated with anatomical and physiological changes in the brain that in turn are coupled to cognitive impairment, impulsivity, and disturbances in concentration and social behavior. Reducing the risk of neglect requires the provision of preventive interventions at the individual and societal level, both universally and targeted to parents and children in need of special support. Health care services can play a key role in the prevention and early detection of neglect in childhood. },

Med utgångspunkt i en mindre intervjustudie uppmärksammas några av de frågor och dilemman som aktualiseras i samband med detta. Reformen förstås som ett exempel på hur policy reformer ramar in och formar det tolkningsarbete som sker på alla nivåer i utbildningssystemet, vilket mot bakgrund av skolans nuvarande styrningssystem under senare decennier har inneburit ett ökat performativt tryck. Analysen grundar sig på tre intervjuer med specialpedagoger på olika skolor och olika stadier. Sådana aspekter som i intervjuerna framstår som kritiska för hur specialpedagogerna hanterar de förändringar som skrivits fram på myndighetsnivå har identifierats och tematiserats. Resultatet visar hur specialpedagogerna hamnar i en mellanposition mellan rektor och lärararbetslagen, där förhandlingar om olika yrkesgruppers ansvar i förhållande till varandra blir centralt när reformen hanteras. Strävan efter att utarbeta hållbara rutiner och strukturer för att utreda, dokumentera och följa upp stödinsatser framstår som en stor del av specialpedagogernas tolkning av reformen, medan förändringsarbetet på klassrumsnivå blir mindre synligt i deras framställning.  },

En viktig skillnad gäller restriktionerna i migranters arbetsmarknadsrörlighet; en annan skillnad gäller i vilken mån och på vilket sätt det infördes tidsbegränsningar i migranters vistelse och arbete i Sverige.

Employing the concept of availability, in preference to work–life balance, the research found women opted out of roles requiring high degrees of spatial and temporal availability for work, in favour of roles more easily combined with family responsibilities. Such choices led to poor career development, plus the loss of technological expertise and confidence.These outcomes were at odds with the company’s gender equality aims, as well as government objectives to make it easier for women and men to combine work and family, and increase the number of women within ICT. },

The article also very briefly examines the gender dimension of Azerbaijani political activism and protest practices. The questions of how gender stereotypes, together with the more general problem of the digital gender gap, are being used by the state authorities to control the public opinion are also addressed. },

Instead, changes in content are assumed or illustrated anecdotally rather than systematically assessed. This empirical study, covering Swedish and UK news sites within tabloid, quality morning, and local/regional varieties between 2002 and 2012, shows that there is a tabloidization effect in general but that it is stronger in tabloids and in Sweden compared to the UK. Further, this tabloidization can be more precisely described as a shift from political to more lifestyle journalism, as it is in the areas where the prime growth and decline are found. In addition, the study reveals that it is the slower news that increases most suggesting that the immediate character of online news is mediated by production conditions },

   abstract = {Background: Hazardous healthcare settings, for example acute care, need to focus more on preventing adverse events and preventive actions across the care delivery chain (i.e pre-hospital and emergency care, and further at the hospital ward) should be more studied. Pressure ulcer prevalence is still at unreasonably high levels, causing increased healthcare costs and suffering for patients. Recent biomedical research reveals that the first signs of cell damage could arise within minutes. However, few studies have investigated optimal pressure ulcer prevention in the initial stage of the care process, e.g. in the ambulance care or at the emergency department. The aim of the study was to describe heel pressure ulcer prevalence and nursing actions in relation to pressure ulcer prevention during the care delivery chain, for older patients with neurological symptoms or reduced general condition. Another aim was to investigate early predictors for the development of heel pressure ulcer during the care delivery chain. Methods: Existing data collected from a multi-centre randomized controlled trial investigating the effect of using a heel prevention boot to reduce the incidence of heel pressure ulcer across the care delivery chain was used. Totally 183 patients participated. The settings for the study were five ambulance stations, two emergency departments and 16 wards at two hospitals in Sweden. Results: A total of 39 individual patients (21 %) developed heel pressure ulcer at different stages across the care delivery chain. Findings revealed that 47-64 % of the patients were assessed as being at risk for developing heel pressure ulcer. Preventive action was taken. However, all patients who developed pressure ulcer during the care delivery chain did not receive adequate pressure ulcer prevention actions during their hospital stay. Discussion and Conclusions: In the ambulance and at the emergency department, skin inspection seems to be appropriate for preventing pressure ulcer. However, carrying out risk assessment with a validated instrument is of significant importance at the ward level. This would also be an appropriate level of resource use. Context-specific actions for pressure ulcer prevention should be incorporated into the care of the patient from the very beginning of the care delivery chain. },

   abstract = {In this article, we present a study of teachers’ experiences, specifically their own perception of their work over time with deaf and hard-of-hearing (DHH) pupils, in both Finland and Sweden. Teachers of DHH pupils are a minority amongst teachers in general, and also amongst special education teachers, because the number of DHH pupils is small. There seems to be a lack of research on experienced teachers’ own perspectives on their practice, their role and experience over time in teaching DHH pupils. The aim of our research is thus to shed light on the work career of experienced educators of DHH pupils and on the main changes in it. In order to understand the current situation of DHH education which is realised mainly in mainstream education today, we need to know its history as well. The research questions are formed as following: 1) What are the main issues that teachers bring up? 2) What elements are there in the teachers’ stories from different decades? A third minor interest is to determine whether the Finnish and Swedish teachers’ stories about their work differ. The narrative approach was chosen here to illustrate teachers’ experiences.  },

   abstract = {We study the homogenization of a reaction-diffusion-convection system posed in an epsilon-periodic delta-thin layer made of a two-component (solid-air) composite material. The microscopic system includes heat flow, diffusion and convection coupled with a nonlinear surface chemical reaction. We treat two distinct asymptotic scenarios: (1) For a fixed width delta &gt; 0 of the thin layer, we homogenize the presence of the microstructures (the classical periodic homogenization limit epsilon --&gt; 0); (2) In the homogenized problem, we pass to delta --&gt; 0 (the vanishing limit of the layer's width). In this way, we are preparing the stage for the simultaneous homogenization (epsilon --&gt; 0) and dimension reduction limit (delta --&gt; 0) with delta = delta (epsilon). We recover the reduced macroscopic equations from [25] with precise formulas for the effective transport and reaction coefficients. We complement the analytical results with a few simulations of a case study in smoldering combustion. The chosen multiscale scenario is relevant for a large variety of practical applications ranging from the forecast of the response to fire of refractory concrete, the microstructure design of resistance-to-heat ceramic-based materials for engines, to the smoldering combustion of thin porous samples under microgravity conditions. },

The medium in question consists of a connected matrix with disconnected, initially periodically distributed inclusions separated by a sharp interface undergoing an a prioriknown interface movement because of phase transformations. After transforming the moving geometry to an ϵ-periodic, fixed reference domain, we establish the well-posedness of the model and derive a number of ϵ-independent a priori estimates.

   abstract = {This study connects to gender issues within the field of science and technology. Women who had started strongly male-dominated engineering educations at Karlstad University were interviewed to find out why they had chosen these programs. A very clear picture emerged about the professions of the women’s fathers. Almost all fathers were engineers or employed in positions that required skills in technology. The women described their fathers as the most important person who had introduced them into the traditionally masculine technology world during childhood. Also other male relatives had influenced the women often in the same way as fathers had done. Mothers had encouraged their daughters for further studies, but not necessarily in the field of science and technology. Mathematics had often been the gateway to studies in science and technology. Thus, these women started early on a trajectory into a technical career. It is discussed if only girls with this strong masculine models and influences can enjoy settings with male norms or if these norms ought to be changed. Results from this study show that it is important to early influence young girls to opportunities that will stimulate their interests in science and technology. Â© 2013 HKIEd APFSLT. },

   abstract = {Lately, the concept of 'resistance' has gained considerable traction as a tool for critically exploring subaltern practices in relation to power. Few researchers, however, have elaborated on the inter-linkage of shifting forms of resistance; and above all, how acts of everyday resistance entangle with more organized and sometimes mass-based resistance activities. In this paper, these entanglements are analysed by taking into consideration the connections between articulations of resistance and technologies of power. Empirical observations from Cambodia are theorized in order to provide better theoretical tools for searching and investigating the inter-linkage between different resistance forms that contribute to social change. In addition, it is argued that modalities of power and its related resistance must be understood, or theorized, in relation to the concepts of 'agency', 'self-reflexivity' and 'techniques of the self'. },

Eye tracking, a visual method of data collection and analysis, was utilised to precisely monitor students’ eye movements while observing geography textbook spreads. In an exploratory study utilising random sampling, the eye movements of 20 students (secondary school students 15–17 years of age and university students 20–24 years of age) were recorded. The research entities were double-page spreads of current German geography textbooks covering an identical topic, taken from five separate textbooks. A two-stage test was developed. Each participant was given the task of first looking at the entire textbook spread to determine what was being explained on the pages. In the second stage, participants solved one of the tasks from the exercise section. Overall, each participant studied five different textbook spreads and completed five set tasks. After the eye tracking study, each participant completed a questionnaire. The results may verify textbook design as one crucial factor for successful knowledge acquisition from textbooks. Based on the eye tracking documentation, learning-related challenges posed by images and complex image-text structures in textbooks are elucidated and related to educational psychology insights and findings from visual communication and textbook analysis. },

   abstract = {This article provides a Bourdieusian analysis of the mediatized lifeworlds of so-called elite cosmopolitans. Based on interviews with Nordic expatriates employed by United Nations organizations in Geneva, the study looks at how the increasing dependence on new media influences the field of United Nations organizations and the trajectories of cosmopolitan subjects. Theoretically, the analysis builds on two key concepts: communicational doxa, which establishes a link between Bourdieu's field theory and critical mediatization theory; and cosmopolitan capital, understood as a sub-form of cultural capital. The findings suggest that mediatization alters the social conditions for accumulating cosmopolitan capital. However, the appropriation and mastery of new media do not hold any symbolic value as such, but tend to expand the possibilities for making investments in the field without altering its overarching logic. It is also shown that new professional media habits are often interwoven with private communication and the emotional needs associated with highly mobile family lives, thus underlining the indirect nature of mediatization in this context. },

The concept is introduced and the relationship between “history�? and “use�? is investigated further from a phenomenological perspective. Use of history is conceptualized as how people actively use the historical culture available to them. Through communication, they explain, build, and transform identities and societies. It is also suggested that use of history is a 3rd aim for history education. In addition to supporting students’ content knowledge and abilities to think historically, this article advocates the need to identify and analyze the role and function of history in contemporary life as an aspect of learning histor },

Den handledning som förekommer i en utbildning beskrivs som ett sätt att stödja och uppmuntra studenterna i deras lärande (Croninger &amp; Lee, 2001), men även handledaren är lärande i handledningssituationen (Anderse�?n, Berglund &amp; Gustavsson, kommande). I artikeln beskriver vi handledningssituationer som berättas i tal eller skrift av handledare, och analyserar de lärar-/handledningsidentiteter som framträder i berättelserna. Vi utgår från ett socialkonstruktionistiskt perspektiv på berättande (Goodson, Biesta, Tedder, &amp; Adair, 2010; Mishler, 1999) där handledarnas narrativa reflektioner kring sina berättelser (Freeman, 2010) har en avgörande roll i rekonstruktionen av handledningssituationen. Handledare i vår studie är lärarutbildare på gymnasiala yrkesprogram som handleder inom verksamhetsförlagd utbildning (VFU), högskolelärare som arbetar med handledningsmodellen Reflekterande Handledning i Omvårdnad (RHiO) inom sjuksköterskeprogrammet samt yrkeslärare som handleder elever inom de gymnasiala yrkesprogrammen. De som blir handledda är följaktligen universitetsstudenter (yrkeslärar- och sjuksköterskestudenter) och yrkeselever. Omgivningen varierar beroende på yrkesutbildning, men är exempelvis för yrkeslärarna gymnasieskolor och deras gymnasielever. Studien visar att de lärar-/handledaridentiteter som framträder ur lärarnas/handledarnas berättelser om deras handledningsarbete handlar om handledare som mentor och förebild, handledare som reflekterande samtalspartner samt handledare som bedömare och kontrollant. Dessutom visar studien att lärarna/handledarna främst positionerar sig gentemot de studenter de handleder, men också att den som bli handledd kan positionera sig i förhållande till sin egen handledare.  },

   abstract = {In 2009 the German Federal Constitutional Court introduced the principle of “public nature of elections�? (Federal Constitutional Court of Germany, March 2009). This principle requires that when using electronic voting systems it must be possible for the citizen to verify the essential steps in the election process and in the ascertainment of the results reliably and without special expert knowledge. Unfortunately, none of the existing systems complies with this principle. As a result, the use of electronic voting systems in Germany for parliamentary elections has stopped. Nevertheless, electronic voting systems are necessary and would improve the situation, especially for elections with complex ballots and voting rules, for example some local elections in Germany or parliamentary elections in Belgium and Luxembourg. The concept proposed by Volkamer et&amp;nbsp;al. (Volkamer et&amp;nbsp;al., 2011) was analyzed by a legal expert and evaluated to comply with the German legal requirements for local elections in the state of Hesse (Henning et&amp;nbsp;al., 2012). In this paper we specify and concretize processes that were left open in the concept, and implement a prototype. We evaluated this prototype in a user study that was conducted alongside the university elections at the Technische Universtität Darmstadt in June 2013. The results of the study show that most of the participants were satisfied with the prototype and would support its use for the upcoming university elections. We also report some lessons learned. },

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Previous studies have mainly compared professionals' and patient's ratings of the importance of different care aspects, finding poor agreement between the groups concerning patient-centered quality of care. There is still little known about the professionals' knowledge of how patients' experience the quality of care they receive during in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatments. The aim of this study was to investigate how IVF health care professionals estimate patients' experience of patient-centered quality of care and if certain factors influenced the IVF professionals' perceptions and IVF patients' experience of quality of care.MATERIAL AND METHODS: All 16 IVF public and private clinics in Sweden participated in this cross sectional study. A total of 268 IVF health care professionals and 3298 patients (women and men) undergoing IVF treatment between January and May 2015 participated by answering the validated questionnaire "Quality from the patient's perspective of in vitro fertilization treatment" (QPP-IVF).RESULTS: Healthcare professionals significantly underestimated patients' satisfaction with the patient-centered quality of care they received in all aspects measured. Both patients and professionals rated the most deficient factors to be 'responsibility/continuity', 'participation' and 'availability'. Healthcare professionals and patients belonging to private clinics evaluated patient-centered care as significantly better than professionals and patients at public clinics in almost all aspects measured.CONCLUSION: The results of this study will increase the professionals understanding of the patients' experiences during IVF treatment and provide additional knowledge when identifying areas to prioritize in order to improve quality of care. },

The study is largely based on calculations from literature data, but key stages are also tested experimentally. It is concluded that a kraft pulp mill can supply the acid demands of the viscose plant via acetic acid formed in the prehydrolysis and sulphuric acid for coagulation, with alkali for mercerization and dissolution, and it can also take care of spent liquors from the viscose plant. The pulp used for regenerated cellulose manufacture is delivered as wet pulp from the pulp mill, no drying is needed and a considerable amount of energy is saved. However, in an integrated production the viscose mill cannot use the whole production of cellulose from the kraft mill. One method of removing zinc ions from the coagulation bath effluents, based on precipitation of zinc sulphide via a well-controlled addition of green liquor from the pulp mill, has been studied. },

In light of an intercultural approach to this question, it seems most fruitful to define Nordic literature as a site of interplay between plural, converging, but also seemingly contradictory regions of identity, a site of continuous change but, most importantly, of human agency, intercultural dialogue and ‘our ability to go beyond the limits set by our existing beliefs and practices’ (Callinicos 2006, p.243). },

When combined, they can develop into insurmountable obstacles. The use of music interventions and activities to overcome some of these obstacles is explored in this article, using two cases of young First Nations people diagnosed with autism, in British Columbia, Canada. Although there are similarities, the differences in severity of ASD, place of residence and school situation, to mention a few factors, make a huge difference in their daily lives. Their contrasting possibilities to be present and participate in society may have implications for their social inclusion in adulthood. Results show that both traditional and contemporary music interventions can provide foundations for inclusion and they need to be carefully designed for each individual. },

   abstract = {Previous studies of intimidation and harassment of journalists have (rightly) focused on non-democratic and authoritarian nations and/or transitional/emerging democracies. In this article, we examine the situation in Sweden, a country with strong de facto and de jure safeguards of journalistic freedom and autonomy. We report the findings from a representative survey of Swedish journalists where three themes are analysed: the extent of harassment, the forms of harassment, and the consequences of intimidation and harassment. The results show that a third of the respondents had experienced threats at work in the past year, and an overwhelming majority said they had received offensive and insulting comments. Intimidation and harassment also had consequences, both professionally and personally, such as fear and self-censorship. We therefore argue that it is time to add the dimension of external pressure and threats to the discussion of journalistic autonomy—including in countries like Sweden. },

   abstract = {This article concerns singing education in folk music, Western classical tradition and improvised music in a music teacher education programme in Sweden. The study investigates how conditions for bodily learning and interpretation are semiotically designed and carried out by vocal teachers in one-to-one singing lessons. Video documentations of singing lessons with three vocal teachers and three students are transcribed and analysed with focus on how musical knowledge and practices of knowledge are bodily represented, designed and expressed, and how students respond to the teachers’ affordances. The theoretical point of view is based on a multimodal and social semiotic perspective. The result shows that all students have the possibility to learn the studied music through bodily understanding, expressions, associations, contextualisation, and interaction, yet the function and the meaning of these bodily learning aspects are varied in the studied lessons. The views of what is counted as musical knowledge, which norms and values are focused on, and which attitudes and methods the teachers work with thus vary depending on context and genre. New knowledge about bodily learning processes and bodily musical meaning making is contributed by the study.

   abstract = {The aim of this article is to investigate interferences between gender, class, sexuality, and ethnicity among international students by looking at migration patterns and living conditions of international master and PhD-students at three Swedish universities (Luleå University of Technology (LTU), Linköping University (LiU), The Royal Institute of Technology (KTH)). The experiences of these students with regard to transnationalism, higher education and research is a point of departure for discussing global stratification and transformation in the contemporary neoliberal knowledge economy. The article interprets the transnational flows of higher education in relation to a critical understanding of knowledge society and higher education by introducing the notion of eduscapes. This concept refers to the contemporary transnational flow of ideas and people with regard to higher education, and where nodes of knowledge centres and peripheries shift over time but are connected through modern communication technologies and different epistemic, ethnic, and student communities. In the transnational practices of higher education where students travel the globe in search and dreams of knowledge, a better life and future career possibilities, routes and imaginaries to a large extent reproduce and follow geopolitical power patterns. In this respect education by going global is shrinking the world but also stratifies, creating new patterns of inequality and competition. },
