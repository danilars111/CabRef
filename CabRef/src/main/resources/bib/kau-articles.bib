   abstract = {Accident models and analysis methods affect what accident investigators look for, which contributory factors are found, and which recommendations are issued. This paper contrasts the Sequentially Timed Events Plotting (STEP) method and the Functional Resonance Analysis Method (FRAM) for accident analysis and modelling. The main issue addressed in this paper is the comparison of the established multi-linear method STEP with the new systemic method FRAM and which new insights the latter provides for accident analysis in comparison to the former established multi-linear method. Since STEP and FRAM are based on a different understandings of the nature of accidents, the comparison of the methods focuses on what we can learn from both methods, how, when, and why to apply them. The main finding is that STEP helps to illustrate what happened, involving which actors at what time, whereas FRAM illustrates the dynamic interactions within socio-technical systems and lets the analyst understand the how and why by describing non-linear dependencies, performance conditions, variability, and their resonance across functions. },

   abstract = {Electricity usage by a household dishwasher can be reduced by using a heat pump system to heat the dishwasher cabinet, dishware and washing water. The evaporator obtains the energy from an energy storage unit which consists of a container filled with water which freezes to ice. The majority of the heat transfer from the energy storage to the evaporator occurs when ice is created in the energy storage unit. A transient simulation model of a dishwasher with a heat pump system was developed and compared to an experimental setup with good agreement. A simulation study of the compressor cylinder volume and the compressor operating time was performed. The results showed a 24% reduction in total electricity use compared to a dishwasher cycle using a traditional electric element. },

   abstract = {The world of online news is a world where news consumers must make choices among a plethora of different news sources. Previous research points towards a fragmentation of news consumption across the citizenry. However, not enough attention has been paid to class, in particular cultural capital, and how it shapes how groups in society develop preferences for different categories of online news. Drawing upon a representative national survey in Sweden (N = 11,108), a country historically known for its egalitarian news consumption, we show that cultural capital engenders patterns of taste and distaste for different online national news providers. This is manifested in that those rich in cultural capital are more inclined to consume ‘quality’ news and to neglect ‘popular’ news. A relative lack of cultural capital is associated with a somewhat reverse pattern. News consumption in the online media landscape is a matter of cultural distinction. },

In this study, we developed an approach for predicting the retention time shifts due to these gradients. The approach is presented as a step-by-step procedure and it is based on empirical linear relationships describing how retention varies as a function of temperature and pressure and how the average column temperature increases with the flow rate. It requires only four experiments on standard equipment, is based on straightforward calculations, and is therefore easy to use in method development. The approach was rigorously validated against experimental data obtained with a quality control method for the active pharmaceutical ingredient omeprazole. The accuracy of retention time predictions was very good with relative errors always less than 1% and in many cases around 0.5% (n = 32). Selectivity shifts observed between omeprazole and the related impurities when changing the flow rate could also be accurately predicted resulting in good estimates of the resolution between critical peak pairs. The approximations which the presented approach are based on were all justified. The retention factor as a function of pressure and temperature was studied in an experimental design while the temperature distribution in the column was obtained by solving the fundamental heat and mass balance equations for the different experimental conditions. We strongly believe that this approach is sufficiently accurate and experimentally feasible for this separation to be a valuable tool when developing a UHPLC method. After further validation with other separation systems, it could become a useful approach in UHPLC method development, especially in the pharmaceutical industry where demands are high for robustness and regulatory oversight. },

   abstract = {Quality Control methods (QC-methods) play an important role in the overall control strategy for drug manufacturing. However, efficient life-cycle management and continual improvement are hindered due to a variety of post-approval variation legislations across territories and a lack of harmonization of the requirements. As a result, many QC-methods fall behind the technical development. Developing the QC-method in accordance with the Quality by Design guidelines gives the possibility to do continual improvements inside the original Method Operable Design Region (MODR). However, often it is necessary to do changes outside the MODR, e.g. to incorporate new technology that was not available at the time the original method was development. Here, we present a method enhancement concept which allows minor adjustments, within the same measuring principle, outside the original MODR without interaction with regulatory agencies. The feasibility of the concept is illustrated by a case study of a QC-method based on HPLC, assumed to be developed before the introduction of UHPLC, where the switch from HPLC to UHPLC is necessary as a continual improvement strategy. The concept relies on the assumption that the System Suitability Test (SST) and failure modes are relevant for other conditions outside the MODR as well when the same measuring principle is used. It follows that it should be possible to move outside the MODR as long as the SST has passed. All minor modifications of the original, approved QC-method must be re-validated according to a template given in the original submission and a statistical equivalence should be shown between the original and modified QC-methods. To summarize, revalidation is handled within the pharmaceutical quality control system according to internal change control procedures, but without interaction with regulating agencies. },

   keywords = {pornography; feminism; american literature; andrea dworkin},
   abstract = {This essay argues that Andrea Dworkin’s much derided argument against pornography may still prove productive if read in relation to her fiction. Taking note of the fact that Dworkin’s own novels have been accused of being pornographic according to her criteria, the essay explores the possibility that her radical feminist anti-porn stance, inevitably described as something of a moralistic backlash by sex-liberals, could be seen as a continuation of the pornographic imagination it so vehemently protests. Through critical readings of Dworkin’s novels Ice and Fire and Mercy, as well as her autobiographical works and theoretical writings on pornography, the essay demonstrates that the contradic- tions that beset her writings echo the contradictions inherent in our contemporary under- standing of pornography. Much like the pornography she would resist, Dworkin’s writings invite a solipsistic mode of reading, the experiential rewards of which are not so much of an interpretive as of a sensual nature. In so doing, Dworkin’s fiction paradoxically proves an invaluable point of entry into the pornographic imagination, making evident its essentially monologic nature. While this circumstance may be damaging for her status as an agitator, it points to her continued—if as yet largely unacknowledged—importance as a writer.  },

   abstract = {Much of the sociolinguistic and stylistic variation which is of interest to linguists is phonetic in nature, but the access route to corpus data is typically via a textual transcription. This poses a significant problem for a researcher who wishes to access the original recordings of speech in order to analyse variation: how can they search for relevant data? Many transcription traditions allow for the representation of such variation through non-standard orthography, and such conventions should therefore allow access to data relevant to the study of variation. However, the specific conventions used vary between traditions (and indeed may not be applied consistently by individual transcribers). This then creates another problem where the researcher wishes to access data across an aggregated collection, which is a practical necessity given the relatively limited size of most corpora of spoken language. In this paper, we analyse the conventions used in two of the component collections in the Australian National Corpus, the Australian Radio Talkback Corpus and the Monash Corpus of Spoken English. On the basis of this analysis, we develop a fragment of an ontology which gives an explicit account of the phenomena related to non-standard pronunciation represented in the transcripts and which can therefore act as the basis for better searching of the collections and better access to relevant data for analysing sociolinguistic and stylistic variation. },

   abstract = {Advance care planning (ACP) is an international concept for improving patient autonomy and communication in the context of anticipated deterioration and end-of-life care. In a preparatory conversation, health care professionals facilitate one or more conversations where nursing home residents are invited to reflect on, and articulate wishes and preferences concerning future medical treatment and end-of-life care. Our aim with this study was to increase knowledge of existing ACP practices in Norwegian nursing homes. We wanted to know how nursing home residents, relatives and nursing home staff take part in the conversations, and to what extent these conversations can be regarded as promoting autonomy, legal rights and individual needs for the residents. We conducted participant observation of seven preparatory conversations, followed by interviews with health care staff (together) and resident and relative (together). In the result section, we present an informative case example of an ACP conversation where common and important characteristics running through our data are present. These are further elaborated under the following headings: Life critical questions, Residents' quiet participation in the conversations, the Dying phase a clinical issue, Nurses and physicians; different domains and Timing. We find that nursing home staff in our study wants to contribute to open awareness, autonomy and a good death, but there are little reflections about the purpose and content of the conversations, how they should be carried out and when, and what frail nursing home residents are able to understand and express in ACP conversations.  },

   abstract = {While the arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbiosis is known to be widespread in terrestrial ecosystems, there is growing evidence that aquatic plants also form the symbiosis. It has been suggested that symbiosis with AM fungi may represent an important adaptation for isoA &lt;&lt; tid plants growing on nutrient-poor sediments in oligotrophic lakes. In this study, we address AM fungal root colonization intensity, richness and community composition (based on small subunit (SSU) ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequencing) in five populations of the isoA &lt;&lt; tid plant species Lobelia dortmanna inhabiting oligotrophic lakes in Southern Sweden. We found that the roots of L. dortmanna hosted rich AM fungal communities and about 15 % of the detected molecular taxa were previously unrecorded. AM fungal root colonization intensity and taxon richness varied along an environmental gradient, being higher in oligotrophic and lower in mesotrophic lakes. The overall phylogenetic structure of this aquatic fungal community differed from that described in terrestrial systems: The roots of L. dortmanna hosted more Archaeosporaceae and fewer Glomeraceae taxa than would be expected based on global data from terrestrial AM fungal communities. },

   abstract = {The purpose of a barrier coating in food packaging is primarily to increase the shelf life of the foodstuff contained within the packaging, preserve its colour, odour, taste and quality, and thereby reduce food wastage (both at retail outlets and households). While most publications hitherto have compared packaging and barrier-coating materials on the basis of their environmental impacts alone, this paper adopts a more holistic approach by factoring in the economic aspect as well. Four barrier material alternatives - Starch, polyethylene, EVOH+kaolin, and latex+kaolin are analysed. Two well-defined end-of-life handling scenarios, relevant to Sweden, are considered - one in which everything except starch is recycled, with starch being composted, and the other in which everything is incinerated. Among the several environmental impact categories which can be analysed, this paper considers only global warming. Two approaches are tested to combine the economic and environmental aspects - normalisation, weighting and aggregating on the one hand, and using the carbon tax to internalize the externality caused by GHG emissions on the other. For the set of weighting factors obtained thanks to a survey conducted by the authors (40.6% for environmental and 59.4% for economic), starch emerges as the most sustainable alternative, followed by polyethylene for both the end-of-life handling scenarios. This tallies with the result obtained by using the carbon tax for internalization of the externality. The case study, methodology and results presented in this paper, will hopefully be a springboard for more detailed studies of this nature, under the umbrella of sustainability },

   abstract = {The following experiment describes an easy experiment for children 11-12 years old, performed during spring in a compulsory school near Karlstad, Sweden. Four different ripe fruits were placed under flowering plants of LL (Impatiens hawkeri) on a table and with plastic bags around both plants and fruits for four days. Two of these fruits produce ethylene to a high degree in connection with ripening, two do not. For one of these high-grade ethylene-producing fruits, apple, the result was very clear. The plants under influence of apple shed many flowers and buds already the first day, due to stimulated senescence caused by ethylene. For the other ethylene-producing fruit, kiwi fruit, the result was clear but not over-explicit as for apple. The other two fruits, orange and lemon, caused flowers and buds to shed in the same proportion as the control plants. From the result a discussion could involve tips of how to stimulate ripening of unripe fruits e.g. by putting apples in the same fruit dish as unripe fruits. Not all unripe fruits, however, will respond to this treatment. Another consequence is not to put flowering plants near ethylene-producing fruits. The experiment is planned in a correct scientific way and thus stimulates discussion about how to design experiments. Other advantages with the experiment are: almost no materials are necessary except pot-plants and fruits which are easy to buy in a garden centre and a grocers shop, the experiment is cheap, it is easy to perform and it stimulates practical work },

Drivande i den fortsatta utvecklingen var fackföreningsrörelsen. Kulmen nåddes 1990 då försäkringen fått en för de skadade mycket generös utformning. Arbetsgivarna var fram till 1990 på defensiven, men efter krispolitiken i början av 1990-talet kom de att verka för en försäkring som hade stor likhet med deras uppfattning på 1910-talet. },

In addition, estimates of the homogeneity of treatment effects appear to differ, thus suggesting that inferences of causes of the effectiveness of a TFP vary with research design.},

   keywords = {Substance displacement; Novel psychoactive substances; Legal highs; Drug abuse; Addiction},
   abstract = {Several hundred new synthetic drugs, novel psychoactive substances (NPS) or “legal highs�? have in recent years appeared on the drug market. These can effortlessly be obtained from on-line vendors, offering an easy access to a plethora of new and untested substances, often with unknown or dangerous effects. Several different attempts to reduce the availability of NPS and to prevent accidents and fatalities have been applied by governments around the world. Nonetheless this complex and constantly evolving situation provides palpable dilemmas and challenges to legislators and prevention strategists. One unintended consequence from prohibition and current drug policies occurs when possibly more precarious substances are used to substitute older and more well-known illicit drugs; so called “substance displacement�?. We have performed extensive research on the use of NPS, by analyzing Internet resources (drug discussion forum, on-line questionnaires), and published several NPS studies. During our research we observed how substance displacement is a common issue, with implications for both clinical practices, drug prevention strategies, as well as for legislators. In the present review we discuss two common themes of substance displacement: 1) Synthetic cannabinoids replace herbal cannabis, and 2) Different attempts for self-medication using NPS. Incitements for substance displacement, that exposes the user to possibly more harmful substances, are founded both in legislation (availability of substances and fear of legal repercussions) as well as from certain policies or cultural perceptions of various medical conditions. We offer no obvious solutions to these complications, but would like to contribute to awareness of how these factors effects drug users and how measures intended to reduce harm in many cases have the opposite effects. Further studies on the divergent motivations and different groups of NPS users are highlighted as imperative to find new and realistic solutions going forward.  },

   abstract = {Objective The objective was to investigate relationships between adolescent sleep disturbance and various worry themes. Methods Questionnaire data from 8 cross-sectional collections between 1988 and 2011 were used. The sample included more than 20,000 adolescents aged 15-16. Binary logistic regressions were used for the analyses. Results Sleep disturbance and female sex increased the odds of worrying about all themes. Sleep disturbance shared stronger associations with worry about financial security, accidents/illness, being bullied, and terrorist attacks (odds ratios, 2.65-3.35) compared with worry about environmental destruction or nuclear war (odds ratios, 1.73-2.11). No interactions between sleep and year of investigation were found. Conclusions Little is known about the association between adolescent worry and sleep, and about sleep disturbance and specific worry content. This study shows that the strength in the relationship between adolescent worry and sleep varies with worry themes. Knowledge of the worry content related to sleep may aid in targeting preventions and interventions. },

Syftet med artikeln är att presentera alternativa berättelser och att nyansera den stereotypa bilden av skolpojken som ointresserad av skolan och fångad i en maskulin kultur dominerad av styrka, tävling, rangordnande och motstånd.

Utifrån kritisk diskursteori och queerteori analyseras och diskuteras hur maskulinitet och könspositioner produceras i relation till undervisningens organisation och olika lektionspraktiker. Artikeln avslutar med att konstatera att det finns en mängd sätt för pojkar att vara i skolan som inte ansluter till den stereotypa bilden av skolpojken, eller som självklart kopplats till eller artikulerats som maskulinitet.

   abstract = {The article aims at studying game violence from an “awry�? perspective, i.e. in terms of how games deal with the violence against animals inherent in processes of producing and consuming meat. Rockstar’s notorious Manhunt (2003) is taken as an initial example of how violence in games is usually dealt with. I argue that the focus on gruesome imagery serves an ideological function by hiding the real material violence of the game industry. As an alternative, I suggest that we focus on how games make visible systemic, yet less palpable, forms of ideological violence. My main focus is on how three contemporary open-world games represent the relation between eating meat and the industrial killing of animals.           Three basic conceptual perspectives are combined: Slavoj Žižek’s distinction between subjective and objective violence; Melanie Joy’s conceptualization of cultural carnism as a cognitive scheme; and Ian Bogost’s procedural-rhetorical approach to videogames as models of material processes. These are employed in order to analyze three games taking a varied approach to the representation of meat as food: Rockstar’s Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas (2004), which includes a discursive critique of factory farming without also implementing it as a gameplay mechanic; Lionhead’s Fable II (2008), which implements ethical and political incentives for vegetarianism in the core mechanics of the game, yet allows for varied approaches in role-playing; and Maxis’ The Sims 3 (2009), which seems to include such incentives yet undermines them by dislodging food from its material origin in its model of the game world. },

An Australian team has participated in the International Linguistics Olympiad (IOL) every year since 2009. This paper describes how the competition is run (with a regional first round and a final national round) and the organisation of the competition (a National Steering Committee and Local Organising Committees for each region) and discusses the particular challenges faced by Australia (timing of the competition and distance between the major population centres). One major factor in the growth and success of OzCLO has been the introduction of the online competition, allowing participation of students from rural and remote country areas. The organisation relies on the goodwill and volunteer work of university and school staff but the strong interest amongst students and teachers shows that OzCLO is responding to a demand for linguistic challenges.

   abstract = {Despite its post-Soviet history, Azerbaijan is an under-investigated country in academic research—compared with the other former constituencies, such as the Baltic countries or Russia, of the USSR—and gender questions of the contemporary Azerbaijani society are even less touched on. Within the current context of the post-“Arab Spring�? era of mediatized connectivity and collective political engagement, this article looks into and analyzes how Azerbaijani women participate in different online and offline social and political movements, and if (and how) they are impeded by the increased state authoritarianism in Azerbaijan. Using data, obtained from online information resources, yearly reports of human rights organizations, focus group discussions, and interviews, the study detects four major activist constellations within the Azerbaijani field of gendered politics. Based on the analysis of conditions of detected groups, the article claims that flash mobs, a tactic employed mainly by liberal activists, emerge as the promising way in overcoming the normative nature of Azerbaijani patriarchal society, thus providing an opportunity for normalization and internalization of the feeling of being on the street and acting in concert with others—the practices which might lead towards an increasing participation of (especially young) women in the political processes of the country. },

   abstract = {We consider some extensions of the classical discrete Boltzmann equation to the cases of multicomponent mixtures, polyatomic molecules (with a finite number of different internal energies), and chemical reactions, but also general discrete quantum kinetic Boltzmann-like equations; discrete versions of the Nordheim-Boltzmann (or Uehling-Uhlenbeck) equation for bosons and fermions and a kinetic equation for excitations in a Bose gas interacting witha Bose-Einstein condensate. In each case we have an H-theorem and so for the planar stationary half-space problem, we have convergence to an equilibrium distribution at infinity (or at least a manifold of equilibrium distributions). In particular, we consider the nonlinear half-space problem of condensation and evaporation for these discrete Boltzmann-like equations. We assume that the flow tends to a stationary point at infinity and that the outgoing flow is known at the wall, maybe also partly linearly depending on the incoming flow. We find that the systems we obtain are of similar structures as for the classical discrete Boltzmann equation (for single species), and that previously obtained results for the discrete Boltzmann equation can be applied after being generalized. Then the number of conditions on the assigned data at the wall needed for existence of a unique solution is found. The number of parameters to be specified in the boundary conditions depends on if we have subsonic or supersonic condensation or evaporation. All our results are valid for any finite number of velocities. },

   abstract = {Our aim was to investigate the epidemiology of burned patients admitted to hospitals in Sweden, and to examine temporal trends during the last three decades. Our hypothesis was that there has been an appreciable decline in the number of patients admitted. Retrospective data about burned patients treated at Swedish hospitals 1987 - 2010 were obtained from the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare. Patients with primary or secondary ICD diagnoses of burns were included, reviewed and statistically interpreted in terms of sex, age, incidence, mortality in hospital and duration of stay. A total of 30,478 patients were admitted to hospitals with burns. The absolute number of admissions declined by 42% (95% CI 39 to 44). There was a highly significant reduction of 45% (95% CI: 38 to 51) in the ageadjusted incidence (admissions/million population) over the years, and the reduction was significant for both sexes. Children aged 0-4 years (n=8308) were most likely to be admitted to hospital (27%). The median duration of stay shortened over time (p &lt; 0.0001). There was an overall significant reduction in deaths at hospital/100 admissions over time (p &lt;0.0001). We think that the improvements are the result of a combination of preventive measures, improved treatments and greater use of outpatient facilities. If we understand these trends and the relations between age-adjusted incidence and actual number of admissions, we can gain insight into what is needed for future provision of emergency health care. },

The combination of pupils’ proven experiences and the leisure-time teachers’ reflective and researching approach proved to be the best route to follow in increasing the quality of the leisure-time centres. The leisure-time centres involved, to a greater extent than before the project, are now built upon a scientific approach as well as the proven experiences of both the pupils and the leisure-time teachers. The project underlines the well-known facts that developmental work needs stability and continuity to lay the foundation for sustainable change and that changes need to be a clear part of the schools’ development organization. },

   abstract = {The flow resistance in 3-dimensional fibrous structures are investigated in particle Reynolds number representing flow characteristics with strong inertia. The resistance coefficients are established based on steady state simulations of single-phase processes of water numerically. An automatized simulation process in COMSOL is developed with a MATLAB algorithm in which production runs could be carried for various 3-dimensional fibrous structures. Simulation of flow processes ranging from Reynolds numbers at creeping flow levels to high Reynolds number at approximately 1000 are calculated and a numerical data set is established in order to estimate Forchheimer coefficients which are used to correlate a dimensionless friction factor to a modified Reynolds expression for porous media. The friction factor and dimensionless permeability are calculated for fibrous structures with (i) disordered unidirectional fibers (ii) an isotropic fiber orientation in-plane perpendicular to the flow, and (iii) an isotropic fiber structure in a the 3-dimensional space. Empirical correlations of the friction factor and Reynolds number are used to compare our simulation data in order to assess the validity of our models and flow resistance estimations. The dimensionless permeability is moreover compared to other numerical simulations of flow through fibrous structures in order to assess flow resistance at low Reynolds number. It is concluded that flow resistance in the isotropic fiber arrangement in space is lower than the in-plane isotropic orientation and disordered unidirectional fiber arrangements at creeping flow conditions, however, all friction actors converges towards the same value at higher Reynolds numbers indicating that fiber orientation is independent at high inertia flow regimes. Overall, our numerical simulations agree well to classical empirical formulations for a wide range of Reynolds number. However, the comparison differs considerably depending on the porosity level. },

   abstract = {Background: Clinical group supervision has existed for over 20 years in nursing. However, there is a lack of studies about the role of supervision in nursing students' education and especially the focus on ethical reasoning. Aim: The aim of this study was to explore and describe nursing students' ethical reasoning and their supervisors' experiences related to participation in clinical group supervision. Research design: The study is a qualitative interview study with interpretative description as an analysis approach. Participants and research context: A total of 17 interviews were conducted with nursing students (n = 12) who had participated in clinical group supervision in their first year of nursing education, and with their supervisors (n = 5). Ethical considerations: The study was based on the ethical principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki, and permission was obtained from the Regional Ethical Review Board in Sweden. Findings: The analysis revealed that both the form and content of clinical group supervision stimulated reflection and discussion of handling of situations with ethical aspects. Unethical situations were identified, and the process uncovered underlying caring actions. Discussion and conclusion: Clinical group supervision is a model that can be used in nursing education to train ethical reflection and to develop an ethical competence among nursing students. Outcomes from the model could also improve nursing education itself, as well as healthcare organizations, in terms of reducing moral blindness and unethical nursing practice. },

   abstract = {PREMISE OF THE STUDY: Vegetative reproduction and spread through clonal growth plays an important role in arctic-alpine ecosystems with short cool growing seasons. Local variation in winter snow accumulation leads to discrete habitat types that may provide divergent conditions for sexual and vegetative reproduction. Therefore, we studied variation in clonal structure of a dominant, evergreen, dwarf shrub (Empetrum nigrum s.l. with the two taxa E. nigrum L. s.s. and E. hermaphroditum Hagerup) along a snow cover gradient and compared clonal diversity and spatial genetic structure between habitats. METHODS: We studied 374 individual shoots using 105 polymorphic AFLP markers and analyses based on hierarchical clustering, clonal diversity indices, and small-scale spatial genetic structure with pairwise kinship coefficient. We used two approaches to define a threshold of genotypic distance between two samples that are considered the same clone. Clonality was examined among three habitats (exposed ridges, sheltered depressions, birch forest) differing in snow conditions replicated in four study regions in Norway and Sweden. KEY RESULTS: Clonality of E. hermaphroditum differed between habitats with an increase in clonal diversity with decreasing snow depth. Small-scale spatial genetic structure increased with decreasing clonal diversity and increasing clone size. In three study regions, E. hermaphroditum was the only species, whereas in one region E. nigrum also occurred, largely confined to exposed ridges. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrated that snow cover in conjunction with associated habitat conditions plays an important role for the mode of propagation of the dwarf shrub E. hermaphroditum. },

Results highlight that while positive interactions with medical staff (doctors) lead to increased well-being through engaging in coproducing treatment options, interactions with friends and family and their associated cocreated activities have an even greater positive effect on well-being. Furthermore, several other customer directed activities have positive indirect effects. Interestingly, activities requiring change can have a negative effect on well-being, except in psychological illnesses, where the opposite is true. The authors conclude with theoretical and managerial implications, highlighting that if interactions and activities with medical professionals are supplemented with customer-directed activities, the positive effect on well-being is significantly enhanced. },

Objective: The present feasibility study focuses on Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQOL) and life satisfaction of parents of children with chronic conditions. Method: The study was conducted using a repeated measures design and applied either group-based cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT; n = 10) or a group-based mindfulness programme (MF; n = 9). The study participants were wait-listed for six months. Results:The results indicate improvements for participants in both treatment groups regarding certain areas of HRQOL and life satisfaction. After eight group therapy sessions, parents in the two treatment groups significantly improved their Mental Component Summary (MCS) scores as well as their scores on the mental subscales Vitality, Social functioning, Role emotional and Mental health. In addition, some of the physical subscales, Role physical, Bodily pain and General health, showed considerable improvement for the MF group. When testing for clinical significance by comparing the samples with mean values of a norm population, the MCS scores were significantly lower at pre-measurements, but no significant differences were observed post-measurement. For the Physical component summary (PCS) scores, a significantly higher score was observed at post-measurement when compared to the norm population. Moreover, the results indicate improvement in life satisfaction regarding Spare time, Relation to child and Relation to partner. Conclusion: The study concludes that CBT and mindfulness may have a positive effect on areas of HRQOL and life satisfaction. },

From being considered secondary to primary psychiatric disorders, comorbid insomnia is now considered an independent health issue that warrants treatment in its own right. Cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is an evidence-based treatment for insomnia. The effects from CBT-I on comorbid psychiatric conditions have received increasing interest as insomnia comorbid with psychiatric disorders has been associated with more severe psychiatric symptomologies, and there are studies that indicate effects from CBT-I on both insomnia and psychiatric symptomology. During recent years, the literature on CBT-I for comorbid psychiatric groups has expanded and has advanced methodologically. This article reviews recent studies on the effects from CBT-I on sleep, daytime symptoms and function and psychiatric comorbidities for people with anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder, psychotic disorders and post-traumatic stress disorder.

   abstract = {We report the results of a simulation study in which we explore the joint effect of group absorptive capacity (as the average individual rationality of the group members) and cognitive distance (as the distance between the most rational group member and the rest of the group) on the emergence of collective rationality in groups. We start from empirical results reported in the literature on group rationality as collective group level competence and use data on real-life groups of four and five to validate a mathematical model. We then use this mathematical model to predict group level scores from a variety of possible group configurations (varying both in cognitive distance and average individual rationality). Our results show that both group competence and cognitive distance are necessary conditions for emergent group rationality. Group configurations, in which the groups become more rational than the most rational group member, are groups scoring low on cognitive distance and scoring high on absorptive capacity. },

   keywords = {HPLC, pH, Adsorption, Omeprazole},
   abstract = {The adsorption of the proton-pump inhibitor omeprazole was investigated using RP-LC with chemometric models combined with adsorption isotherm modelling to study the effect of pH and type of organic modifier (i.e., acetonitrile or methanol). The chemometric approach revealed that omeprazole was tailing with methanol and fronting with acetonitrile along with increased fronting at higher pH. The increased fronting with higher pH for acetonitrile was explored using a pH-dependent adsorption isotherm model that was determined using the inverse method and it agreed well with the experimental data. The model indicated that the peaks exhibit more fronting at high pH due to a larger fraction of charged omeprazole molecules. This model could accurately predict the shape of elution profiles at arbitrary pH levels in the studied interval. Using a two-layer adsorption isotherm model, the difference between acetonitrile and methanol was studied at the lowest pH at which almost all omeprazole molecules are neutral. Omeprazole had adsorbate–adsorbate interactions that were similar in strength for the acetonitrile and methanol mobile phases, while the solute–adsorbent interactions were almost twice as strong with methanol. The difference in the relative strengths of these two interactions likely explains the different peak asymmetries (i.e., tailing/fronting) in methanol and acetonitrile. In conclusion, thermodynamic modelling can complement chemometric modeling in HPLC method development and increase the understanding of the separation. },

The aim of the experimental concept study presented here was to evaluate a new drying method for a heat pump dishwasher. In this method, the drying of the dishware occurs as a fan circulates humid air in a closed system in which the water on the dishware evaporates inside the warm dishwasher cabinet and then condenses on a cold surface of the frozen water tank. The evaluation of drying performance was based on the European standard EN50242, which considers visible water drops left on the dishware after a completed dishwashing cycle. The results showed that this new closed drying method was more energy efficient compared to an existing open drying method, and that the drying start temperature and the drying time had a significant effect on the drying performance. Its lower electricity consumption and the fact that it does not vent humid air into the kitchen gives this heat pump dishwasher a competitive advantage over dishwashers using an open drying method. },

In addition, we detail how these two methods tackle content analysis pillars such as mode of analysis, sampling, sampling size, variable design, unit of analysis, measuring point(s), access/capture/storing, conclusions/generalizability and the key agent doing the actual work. We summarize the article by arguing that established content analysis is insufficient for digital media but that common standards, protocols and procedures are yet to be developed for these new approaches to digital journalism research. },

Drawing on quantitative and qualitative data for the construction sector, the article addresses three questions. How do employers balance their flexibility preferences in the context of regulatory constraints? How has the global recession influenced employer behaviour? And to what extent can the Swedish experience be explained by convergence on other country models? While the UK employment model encourages employers to externalise the risk of unpredictable market conditions through the use of contingent contracts, the more supportive welfare regime in Sweden underpins a resilient preference of employers for open-ended employment contracts. Ongoing changes in labour market regulation pose challenges to the strongly regulated Swedish model, yet we find only a shared direction of travel with the UK rather than convergence in the use of contingent employment. },

   abstract = {Objective: This paper analyzes how primary care physician visits are affected by the level of copayment in Sweden. Data source: We use data between the years 2003-2012 from 21 Swedish health care regions that have the mandate to set their own level of copayment. The copayment per visit varies between 10 and 20 for these years and regions. Study design: Our strategy to identify the causal effect and deal with unobserved endogeneity of price changes on physician visits is based on a panel data model using fixed effects to control for region and time and regional-variation in time trends. Principal finding: We cannot reject that the copayment has no statistical or economic effect of significance, and we estimate the "zero effect" with very high precision. Conclusion: In a setting with sub-national regions with autonomy to set copayments the results points to that the copayment is not an important predictor for the number of health care visits. The result is in line with some previous studies on European data where the range of copayments used tends to be relatively low.  },

In this study, utilization of such FB boilers for production of syngas in dual fluidized bed gasifiers and subsequent catalytic biofuel production to substitute natural gas (SNG), methanol (MeOH) and Fischer-Tropsch fuel (FT) has been examined. Based on the hypothesis that waste-heat and tail gas from the biofuel processes can be utilized in the CHP plant, process configurations aiming for operationally robustness and low investment cost rather than maximum stand-alone efficiency have been explored and implemented in actual industrial cases and over the full operating range of the boilers. The results of the study show that significant improvements of overall efficiency can be achieved by integration of the biofuel processes in the CHP plants and that a relatively high biofuel production capacity can be achieved. SNG showed the highest obtainable efficiency and production capacity of the studied biofuels, whereas the FT process showed largest increase in terms of efficiency when integrated in the CHP plant, compared to its stand-alone efficiency. },

The medium in question consists of a connected matrix with disconnected, initially periodically distributed inclusions separated by a sharp interface undergoing a priori known phase transformations. While such estimates seem not to be obtainable in the fully coupled setting, we show that for some simplified scenarios optimal convergence rates can be proven rigorously. The main technique for the proofs are energy estimates using special reconstructions of two-scale functions and particular operator estimates for periodic functions with zero average. Here, additional regularity results for the involved functions are necessary. },

Our continuous model consists of the continuity equation for the density of the crowd and a kinetic equation for the velocity field. The latter includes a nonlocal term that models interactions between individuals. To support our modelling assumptions, we introduce an inequality that resembles the Second Law of Thermodynamics, containing an entropy-like functional. We show that its time derivative equals a positive dissipation term minus a corrector term. The latter term should be small for the time derivative of the entropy to be positive. In case of isotropic interactions the corrector term is absent. For the anisotropic case, we support the claim that the corrector term is small by simulations for the corresponding particle system. They reveal that this term is sufficiently small for the entropy still to increase. Moreover, we show that the entropy converges in time towards a limit value. },

A model of recurrent updating of current mood is developed and compared to a model of how a sequence of events evoking emotional responses is evaluated retrospectively. In Experiment 1, 149 undergraduates are presented sequences of lottery outcomes with a fixed probability of losing or winning different amounts of money. Ratings of current mood are made after the sequence. Retrospective evaluations are either made after the ratings of current mood or, in a control condition, when no ratings of current mood are made. The results show an expected effect on current mood of the valence of the end of the sequence. The results are less clear in showing an expected beginning effect on the retrospective evaluations. An expected beginning effect on retrospective evaluations is found in Experiment 2 in which 41 undergraduates are first asked to remember the different amounts of money, then to evaluate the sequence as lottery outcomes. },

   abstract = {It is widely recognized that the Internet transport layer has become ossified, where further evolution has become hard or even impossible. This is a direct consequence of the ubiquitous deployment of middleboxes that hamper the deployment of new transports, aggravated further by the limited flexibility of the Application Programming Interface (API) typically presented to applications. To tackle this problem, a wide range of solutions have been proposed in the literature, each aiming to address a particular aspect. Yet, no single proposal has emerged that is able to enable evolution of the transport layer. In this work, after an overview of the main issues and reasons for transport-layer ossification, we survey proposed solutions and discuss their potential and limitations. The survey is divided into five parts, each covering a set of point solutions for a different facet of the problem space: 1) designing middlebox- proof transports, 2) signaling for facilitating middlebox traversal, 3) enhancing the API between the applications and the transport layer, 4) discovering and exploiting end-to-end capabilities, and 5) enabling user-space protocol stacks. Based on this analysis, we then identify further development needs towards an overall solution. We argue that the development of a comprehensive transport layer framework, able to facilitate the integration and cooperation of specialized solutions in an application-independent and flexible way, is a necessary step toward making the Internet transport architecture truly evolvable. To this end, we identify the requirements for such a framework and provide insights for its development.  },

   volume = {12},
   abstract = {2013 infördes en ny reform om karriärvägar för lärare. Genom att tillsätta 17 000 lärare i en ny position, en formellt högre befattning – förstelärare - förväntas reformen förutom att bidra till skolutveckling och förbättrad måluppfyllelse även att höja läraryrkets status. Efter reformens två första år konstateras att förstelärarpositionen domineras av kvinnor. I artikeln belyses de villkor som kvinnor i lärarkarriärer mött och fortfarande möter, villkor som relateras till de positioner som förstelärarna upplever sig ha. Data från intervjuer och enkäter belyser hur första generationens förstelärare själva upplever att lärarkollegor ser på deras nya position och hur de själva hanterar dessa bemötanden. I analysen av data har vi inspirerats av ett teoretiskt ramverk av Wahl, Holgersson och Höök (1998) om hur ironi och motstånd används för att hantera skilda positioner bland kollegor. Resultaten visar framförallt hur förstelärare utsätts för ironiska kommentarer och gliringar från kollegor, men även hur förstelärare gör motstånd och hävdar sin position.    Begreppet position används i artikeln i två betydelser. Å ena sidan refererar position till den formella befattningen som förstelärarna har fått genom förordnandet. Å andra sidan hänvisar positionsbegreppet till den symboliska plats som förstelärarna försätts och försätter sig själva i genom interaktion med andra i yrkesvardagens praktiker. },

   abstract = {The authors are developing anthropomorphic musical performance robots as an approach to understand the human motor control and to enhance the human-robot interaction from an engineering point of view. For this purpose; since 1990, we have developed an anthropomorphic flutist robot. As one of our long-term approaches, we aim to develop an anthropomorphic musical performance robot capable of playing different kinds of woodwind instruments, e.g. flute and saxophone. In this paper, the improvements of the mechanical design and sensing system of the Waseda Flutist Robot No. 4 Refined V (WF-4RV) are detailed. As for the sensing system, an array of sensors has been designed to detect the lip's pressure distribution. On the other hand, the lips and lung have been re-designed to enable the flutist robot to play the saxophone. },

   abstract = {Contemporary diplomacy is subject to the same pressures of globalization as many other communication industries. However, insights from different areas of Media and Communication Studies have only been partly explored in the context of diplomacy. This article applies theories of transmedia storytelling, transmedia engagement and surveillance upon a case study of the recent Campaign to End Sexual Violence in Conflict. The aim is to investigate the ways in which contemporary diplomatic advocacy campaigns cope with fundamental problems such as media repertoires, co-created content, collective intelligence, digital convergence and stakeholder management. The article contends that co-creation and co-option of shared values through transmedia engagement techniques perform a disciplining role for stakeholders that may be linked to theories of surveillance and biopolitics. This study will be of much relevance to those interested in the significance of participatory culture theories to contemporary international advocacy, including its policies, strategies and mediating practices. },

   abstract = {An important aspect of constructing discrete velocity models (DVMs) for the Boltzmann equation is to obtain the right number of collision invariants. It is a well-known fact that DVMs can also have extra collision invariants, so called spurious collision invariants, in plus to the physical ones. A DVM with only physical collision invariants, and so without spurious ones, is called normal. For binary mixtures also the concept of supernormal DVMs was introduced, meaning that in addition to the DVM being normal, the restriction of the DVM to any single species also is normal. Here we introduce generalizations of this concept to DVMs for multicomponent mixtures. We also present some general algorithms for constructing such models and give some concrete examples of such constructions. One of our main results is that for any given number of species, and any given rational mass ratios we can construct a supernormal DVM. The DVMs are constructed in such a way that for half-space problems, as the Milne and Kramers problems, but also nonlinear ones, we obtain similar structures as for the classical discrete Boltzmann equation for one species, and therefore we can apply obtained results for the classical Boltzmann equation. },

   abstract = {In 2010 and 2011 several political leaders in Europe took distance from the multicultural society model. The concept of cultural heritage has been central to this political debate. But this concept is also central in education and actively used both in the general part of the curriculum in Norway and also in the curricula of several subjects. This article examines how «cultural heritage» is defined and used in three central curricula: Norwegian, Religious Studies and Ethics (KRLE), and Social Sciences, at a macro level (subject’s purpose) and also at a micro level (learning outcomes). To analyze how this concept is used in these curricula is an important premise for being able to think critically about this concept within the classroom. It also creates a better prerequisite for understanding the extent to which these subjects are focusing on a more or less dynamic and inclusive understanding of identity, as well as a self-reflexive and critical skills development },

As a senior lecturer in plant physiology at University of Karlstad I have simplified experiments intended for students at university and then tested them on 10-11 year old pupils in compulsory school. Pupils have cultivated seedlings of peas in normal day/night conditions and in darkness during two school weeks. Differences in length, form of leaves and colours are striking and easy to explain. Besides these clear results the experiment has many advantages: it is easy to prepare and carry out, it requires very little equipment and it is cheap. The theory is simple and most important: it stimulates to further studies in biology },

ESD is mentioned in the geography curricula but without explanation and implementation.

   keywords = {Arrhenatheretalia, degradation of vegetation, grassland, Polish Sudetes Mts, species richness},
   abstract = {The degradation of species-rich mountain meadows has been observed in many parts of Central Europe in the last few decades. It is reflected in decreasing species numbers and changes in the proportions of plant species in the aboveground vegetation. Some species are increasing in abundance and eventually dominate the meadow vegetation. There is still a lack of studies explaining how this process is reflected in the soil seed bank. Therefore, the goal of the current study was to test whether expansive species that degrade aboveground vegetation of mountain meadows also influence, quantitatively and qualitatively, seed rain and seed bank. Soil samples were taken from 14 plots in degraded patches and another 14 plots in non-degraded patches. Nearly the same numbers of seedlings were recorded in both meadow types. In both cases, low similarities between aboveground vegetation and soil seed rain and seed bank were observed. Expansive species causing meadow degradation (Calamagrostis epigejos, Festuca rubra, Deschampsia cespitosa and Lupinus polyphyllus) reached cover values of 60-83% in the aboveground vegetation, and a share of up to 36% in the seed rain and seed bank. The mean species richness in the aboveground vegetation and the soil of degraded meadows was lower than in the non degraded plots. However, the seed bank may buffer degradation to some extent since the degradation of aboveground vegetation was faster than impoverishment of seed bank. Consequently, seed rain and seed bank of degraded meadows still contained typical mesic meadow species in similar proportions as non-degraded meadows. This indicates that seed rain and seed bank may contribute to the restoration of degraded meadows after the removal of expansive species from the aboveground vegetation. },

   abstract = {Fundamental diagrams describing the relation between pedestrians' speed and density are key points in understanding pedestrian dynamics. Experimental data evidence the onset of complex behaviors in which the velocity decreases with the density, and different logistic regimes are identified. This paper addresses the issue of pedestrian transport and of fundamental diagrams for a scenario involving the motion of pedestrians escaping from an obscure tunnel. We capture the effects of communication efficiency and exit capacity by means of two thresholds controlling the rate at which particles (walkers, pedestrians) move on the lattice. Using a particle system model, we show that in the absence of limitation in communication among pedestrians, we reproduce with good accuracy the standard fundamental diagrams, whose basic behaviors can be interpreted in terms of exit capacity limitation. When the effect of limited communication ability is considered, then interesting nonintuitive phenomena occur. In particular, we shed light on the loss of monotonicity of the typical speed-density curves, revealing the existence of a pedestrian density optimizing the escape. We study both the discrete particle dynamics and the corresponding hydrodynamic limit (a porous medium equation and a transport (continuity) equation). We also point out the dependence of the effective transport coefficients on the two thresholds---the essence of the microstructure information.Read More: http://epubs.siam.org/doi/10.1137/15M1030960 },

   abstract = {The purpose of this article is to explore the concept of availability, both empirically and theoretically, in the context of three Swedish organisations, and identifies the structural influences on availability patterns for work and family. Design/methodology/approach - The article is based on quantitative case studies using employer records and an employee questionnaire in three organisations. Multivariate descriptive statistics and multivariate logistic regression are used to illustrate and analyse patterns of availability for work and family. Findings - The descriptive data demonstrate the influence of the organisational context and type of production process, as well as gender, on availability patterns. Patterns of work availability appeared to differ across the organisations to a greater extent than patterns of family availability, which were highly gendered. The logistic regression results indicated that: occupation was a significant influence on both temporal and spatial availability patterns across the organisations; gender was the most significant influence on time spent on household work and part-time working for parents with young children; age of employees and age of employees' children were the most significant factors influencing the use of time off work for family. Research limitations/implications - Analysis limited to case studies. More extensive quantitative research would be needed to make empirical generalisations. Qualitative research would be needed to establish whether and how employees are able to make use of different availability patterns to improve their work-life balance. Originality/value - The concept of availability is a new way of trying to capture and analyse tensions in people's everyday lives as they try to manage multiple demands. },

   abstract = {Hur kommer det sig att tilltron till systematik och vetenskap är så stor i dagens utbildningssystem? Är det så att vetenskap likställds med säker och sann kunskap som kan användas för att komma till rätta med skolans aktuella problem och dilemman? Flera av de reformer som genomförts syftar till att få skolans professionella att inta ett mer vetenskapligt förhållningssätt vilket har bidragit till att intresset för praktikorienterade studier har ökat och att idag är allt fler lärare och rektorer aktiva aktörer i uppbyggnaden av den vetenskapliga forskningen. I arbetet med denna text konstaterar jag att det finns kopplingar att finna mellan den rådande diskursen om skolans vetenskaplighet och kraven på hög måluppfyllelse och goda elevresultat. I en tid då utbildningsnivå betraktas som ett viktigt konkurrensmedel hamnar stort fokus på skolans måluppfyllelse och elevernas resultat och på vilket sätt dessa kan förbättras snabbt och effektivt. Vad sker med undervisningen och skolans ledarskap i kölvattnet efter omvärldens ökade krav på vetenskap och systematik? I dag ligger makten och ansvaret för skolans utveckling till stor del på andra än på skolans professionella. Hur kan den maktbalansen förändras till fördel för lärare och rektorer? Slutligen har jag även reflekterat över hur denna utveckling legat till grund för mitt val av aktionsforskning som vetenskaplig ansats i det egna avhandlingsarbetet. },

   abstract = {The use of renewable resources for bioenergy should be performed to support sustainable development. Since the use of bioenergy has increased significantly worldwide in recent years and biomass is made of limited resources it must be used efficiently and with a low environmental impact The wood fuel pellet industry has the possibility to meet these criteria; however, it also has the potential for improvements. This work investigates how the additives, cornstarch and molasses, affect: the electricity consumption of the pellet press, the emission of Carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2 eq.) from the production of wood fuel pellets in three different countries with different emissions from electricity, the durability of the pellets and its effects on energy efficiency. The results show that pellet production is more energy efficient when additives are used, and that the amount of CO2 eq. increases with an increased use of additives. In countries with a low usage of fossil fuels for electricity production, the global warming impact gets higher due to the additives; while in countries that use a lot of fossil fuels to produce electricity, the global warming impact will be reduced because of the additives by up to 1%. The increased global warming impact from the additives can be balanced by the decrease in the reduced amount of rejected material within the production. That is because the durability of the pellets increases with an increasing amount of additive. },

A priori and a posteriori error estimates for the semi-discrete fields of active concentrations and for the position of the moving interface are obtained. The important feature of the system of partial differential equations is that the nonlinear coupling occurs due to the presence of both the moving boundary and the non-linearities of localized sinks and sources by reaction. },

Characterisations of knowledge contributions in subject didactics and RE are used as analytical tools while the study as a whole draws on socio-cultural perspectives on learning and activity theory which stress how learning takes place in the discursive practices where people are active. A striking similarity between the dissertations is that none of them has been developed in an in an RE discipline, with an RE supervisor, or in an academic milieu specialising in RE. The different academic contexts have contributed to interesting combinations and developments of theoretical perspectives but simultaneously there is a lack of milieus that deal with these findings and integrate them into further developmental processes. Moreover, there seem to be larger differences in RE knowledge contributions between the dissertations and the textbooks as groups than within these groups. While the dissertations represent empirical studies of the participants in the teaching practices and use the findings as foundations for discussions and problematisations of RE teaching, the student teacher texts take the RE content and curriculum for granted to a larger extent. One conclusion of this article is that in order to strengthen the RE field – both in school, teacher education and research – extended cooperation between these different practices is needed. },

   keywords = {actor-to-actor; value creation; service ecosystems; markets-as-practice; value co-creation practices; institutional work},
   abstract = {This article explores how seemingly distinct actors contribute to value creation and evaluation in a fundamentally similar way. It shows that the division of actors into dichotomies such as producers and consumers, paying and non-paying customers, and adopters and non-adopters, is based on narrow, unidirectional, transactional, and dyadic views on value creation and delivery. The article highlights the limitations of these views and draws on a service ecosystems perspective and its broader notion of co-created and contextual value to overcome these limitations. More specifically, the article, by connecting two frameworks (markets-as-practice and institutional work), extends a generic actor-to-actor conceptualization of value creation, in showing that all economic and social actors participate in value creation in a fundamentally similar way. That is, they enact value co-creation practices and simultaneously shape these practices by creating, maintaining and disrupting the institutions that guide their (re)enactment. Thus, the article proposes a unified view on actorsâ participation in value creation that not only points to the involvement of broader actor categories in value creation and market formation processes, but also provides important strategic implications in the form of a research agenda. },

   abstract = {Background: The aim of this study was to determine the influence of selected physiological, psychological and situational factors on experience of fatigue, and functional limitations due to fatigue in patients with stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Methods: In total 101 patients with COPD and 34 control patients were assessed for experience of fatigue, functional limitation due to fatigue (Fatigue Impact Scale), physiological [lung function, 6-minute walk distance (6MWD), body mass index (BMI), dyspnoea, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), surfactant protein D], psychological (anxiety, depression, insomnia), situational variables (age, sex, smoking, living alone, education), and quality of life. Results: Fatigue was more common in patients with COPD than in control patients (72% versus 56%, p &lt; 0.001). Patients with COPD and fatigue had lower lung function, shorter 6MWD, more dyspnoea, anxiety and depressive symptoms, and worse health status compared with patients without fatigue (all p &lt; 0.01). No differences were found for markers of systemic inflammation. In logistic regression, experience of fatigue was associated with depression [odds ratio (OR) 1.69, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.28-2.25) and insomnia (OR 1.75, 95% CI 1.19-2.54). In linear regression models, depression, surfactant protein D and dyspnoea explained 35% (R-2) of the variation in physical impact of fatigue. Current smoking and depression explained 33% (R-2) of the cognitive impact of fatigue. Depression and surfactant protein D explained 48% (R-2) of the psychosocial impact of fatigue. Conclusions: Experiences of fatigue and functional limitation due to fatigue seem to be related mainly to psychological but also to physiological influencing factors, with depressive symptoms, insomnia problems and dyspnoea as the most prominent factors. Systemic inflammation was not associated with perception of fatigue but surfactant protein D was connected to some dimensions of the impact of fatigue },

   abstract = {This study examines temporal trends in deaths due to fire-related accidents in Sweden from 1952 to 2013 based on statistics in the Cause of Death register held by the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare. Fatalities coded with underlying cause of death associated with fire-related accidents are included and absolute numbers and age-adjusted mortality rates are calculated and statistically analysed for trends using Poisson regression. The results show a significant reduction in both absolute numbers and in the age-adjusted mortality rate with a decline in absolute number of deaths of 34% over the period. However, the elderly population (80+ years) showed a significant increase in absolute numbers. Regarding the age-adjusted mortality rate, a significant reduction of 63% was observed and children aged 0 to 4 years showed the largest decrease (91%). A reduction was seen both in terms of fatalities due to burns and carbon monoxide poisoning, although the reduction was more pronounced with regards to burns (69% compared to 46%). Although an overall decrease was observed in both absolute numbers and in the age-adjusted mortality rate, with an aging population, the absolute numbers of fire-related deaths for the elderly population will most likely increase in the future. Therefore, whilst previously a child-injury issue, fire-related deaths in Sweden is now predominantly an issue of safety for the elderly. In combination with more deaths now being attributed to carbon monoxide poisoning, new preventative strategies may be required },

   abstract = {Risk assessments are important to ensure efficient and effective flood risk management. Methods and strategies for flood risk assessment are described in the literature, but less is known about how assessments are actually performed. We have studied local flood risk assessments in Sweden by interviewing flood risk managers in municipalities and analyzing documentation of flood risk assessment efforts. There is a large variation between municipalities in how flood risk assessment has been done. The efforts made in association with the EU Floods Directive together with a Government Commission about a flood in Lake Malaren are the most advanced assessments. Only a few of the municipalities have done comparable assessments. Generally, however, there is a lack of experience and theoretical knowledge about concepts and methods of flood risk assessment in the municipalities. In the assessments studied, the flood itself had been rather well defined in hazard maps. The consequences of a flood had been studied in the larger projects but only by half of the municipalities. It is mainly direct, tangible consequences that have been included. It is mainly the exposure of assets that has been investigated while little attention has been paid to vulnerability. To improve flood risk assessment in Sweden there is a need for knowledge and resources in the municipalities. Prioritization and motivation are needed to actually perform the assessments. National guidelines for may be helpful to guide municipalities in this work and to have more uniform risk assessment. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. },

This longitudinal analysis of Sweden’s four major mainstream national news websites focuses on front-page news items to investigate to what extent user participation has increased over time and whether the participatory features present allow users to exert control over key journalistic processes. Its findings indicate that user participation has increased rapidly in regard to processes peripheral to news journalism, but also that users have to a minor extent begun over time to perform work previously reserved for professional journalists. },

   abstract = {According to previous research, two characteristics of online news as opposed to traditional news are interactivity and immediacy. However, most research in this area has focused on the news site-level of analysis, and there are only a few studies on how interactivity and immediacy affect online news on the news story-level of analysis. The main reason for this appears to be that the very nature of online news makes observation by traditional research methods, such as quantitative content analysis, problematic. Against this background, the overall purpose of this paper is to explore methodological approaches for the study of interactivity and immediacy on the news story-level of online news. The paper develops a three-pronged strategy for freezing the flow of online news to enable systematic content analyses of interactivity and immediacy, and tests this strategy in a comparative analysis of the online news sites Guardian.co.uk in Britain and Aftonbladet.se in Sweden. },

   abstract = {In this article I investigate emancipatory spaces in masculinity studies with the guidance of Karen Barad's work, and in particular concepts such as diffraction and interference. For my purposes, Karen Barad's work opens up for understanding critical differences within regulated emotional spaces and stale relationalities of masculine gender configurations. Diffracted readings in masculinity studies could extend the symbolic space for acceptable forms of intimacy and possibly create emancipatory openings for hegemonic and dominant forms of lust communions. I argue that a sensual and conceptual key to alternative routes of masculine gendered subjectivities is intimacy and vulnerability. As such, vulnerability also connotes and produces a range of conceptual and embodied dyads and triads; empowered-disempowered; embodied-disembodied-ablebodied; homosocial-homoerotic-homosexual; potent-impotent; human-nonhuman; old-young, to mention a few. Vulnerability is also an onto-epistemological vantage point that hopefully and possibly could work our way around classical binaries and do a well-needed job as a form of emancipatory compass. },

   abstract = {This article examines and discusses how successful teachers develop professionally and relate this process to theory and practice. It elucidates some further aspects of an earlier longitudinal, praxis-oriented study in excellence that was carried out over a period of seven years in a nine-year Swedish compulsory school (Tjernberg, 2013). That case study was based on classroom observations and follow-up discussions to create consciousness of learning processes among the teachers and the researcher. According to the teachers in this study, the focus of pedagogical research is seldom on pedagogical practices, which means that they are not felt to be important. In contrast, the research is seen to be important if it has an inside perspective, using mutual and continuous communication between the pupils, themselves, and the researcher. One main finding is that a researcher can contribute to theorising and putting into words the teachers' pedagogical practices. At the same time, the researcher is able to deepen her or his research into issues that arise from the teachers' practices and knowledge. These two conditions are in turn necessary for the individual pupil to develop her or his proximal learning, which leads to further research questions. In this article, the term 'triple learning process' is used to describe this interaction. },

Research in the field of religious education in Iceland has been rather limited, and the question arises, what knowledge is available in that area in the country? All three projects reflect the development of Icelandic society from being relatively homogeneous in religious matters to growing secularization and increasing religious diversity and pluralism. Although their objectives are different, they clearly show how the development of the society affects emphases in the school’s religious education. Therefore their results and discussion provide a foundation of knowledge on religious education in compulsory schools in Iceland or other multicultural societies. In the first projects the historical development in Iceland is described and compared with the development in the other Nordic countries (Denmark, Norway and Sweden) and it effectively creates the background for the other projects. The development of Christian and religious education in Iceland is shaped by the development of the society. In the two other research projects the conclusion is that religious education must take into account the increasing diversity and put the students and their diverse experiences in focus. The emphasis is placed on the idea that the approach to religious education needs to be multicultural, precisely because there are students in the schools with different cultural and religious backgrounds and experiences. It is necessary to take this into account, since factors such as family, home and school affect each other. },

Up to one in six children in the western world experience physical or psychological neglect during their upbringing. Severe neglect is associated with anatomical and physiological changes in the brain that in turn are coupled to cognitive impairment, impulsivity, and disturbances in concentration and social behavior. Reducing the risk of neglect requires the provision of preventive interventions at the individual and societal level, both universally and targeted to parents and children in need of special support. Health care services can play a key role in the prevention and early detection of neglect in childhood. },

Med utgångspunkt i en mindre intervjustudie uppmärksammas några av de frågor och dilemman som aktualiseras i samband med detta. Reformen förstås som ett exempel på hur policy reformer ramar in och formar det tolkningsarbete som sker på alla nivåer i utbildningssystemet, vilket mot bakgrund av skolans nuvarande styrningssystem under senare decennier har inneburit ett ökat performativt tryck. Analysen grundar sig på tre intervjuer med specialpedagoger på olika skolor och olika stadier. Sådana aspekter som i intervjuerna framstår som kritiska för hur specialpedagogerna hanterar de förändringar som skrivits fram på myndighetsnivå har identifierats och tematiserats. Resultatet visar hur specialpedagogerna hamnar i en mellanposition mellan rektor och lärararbetslagen, där förhandlingar om olika yrkesgruppers ansvar i förhållande till varandra blir centralt när reformen hanteras. Strävan efter att utarbeta hållbara rutiner och strukturer för att utreda, dokumentera och följa upp stödinsatser framstår som en stor del av specialpedagogernas tolkning av reformen, medan förändringsarbetet på klassrumsnivå blir mindre synligt i deras framställning.  },

En viktig skillnad gäller restriktionerna i migranters arbetsmarknadsrörlighet; en annan skillnad gäller i vilken mån och på vilket sätt det infördes tidsbegränsningar i migranters vistelse och arbete i Sverige.

Employing the concept of availability, in preference to work–life balance, the research found women opted out of roles requiring high degrees of spatial and temporal availability for work, in favour of roles more easily combined with family responsibilities. Such choices led to poor career development, plus the loss of technological expertise and confidence.These outcomes were at odds with the company’s gender equality aims, as well as government objectives to make it easier for women and men to combine work and family, and increase the number of women within ICT. },

The article also very briefly examines the gender dimension of Azerbaijani political activism and protest practices. The questions of how gender stereotypes, together with the more general problem of the digital gender gap, are being used by the state authorities to control the public opinion are also addressed. },

Instead, changes in content are assumed or illustrated anecdotally rather than systematically assessed. This empirical study, covering Swedish and UK news sites within tabloid, quality morning, and local/regional varieties between 2002 and 2012, shows that there is a tabloidization effect in general but that it is stronger in tabloids and in Sweden compared to the UK. Further, this tabloidization can be more precisely described as a shift from political to more lifestyle journalism, as it is in the areas where the prime growth and decline are found. In addition, the study reveals that it is the slower news that increases most suggesting that the immediate character of online news is mediated by production conditions },

   abstract = {Background: Hazardous healthcare settings, for example acute care, need to focus more on preventing adverse events and preventive actions across the care delivery chain (i.e pre-hospital and emergency care, and further at the hospital ward) should be more studied. Pressure ulcer prevalence is still at unreasonably high levels, causing increased healthcare costs and suffering for patients. Recent biomedical research reveals that the first signs of cell damage could arise within minutes. However, few studies have investigated optimal pressure ulcer prevention in the initial stage of the care process, e.g. in the ambulance care or at the emergency department. The aim of the study was to describe heel pressure ulcer prevalence and nursing actions in relation to pressure ulcer prevention during the care delivery chain, for older patients with neurological symptoms or reduced general condition. Another aim was to investigate early predictors for the development of heel pressure ulcer during the care delivery chain. Methods: Existing data collected from a multi-centre randomized controlled trial investigating the effect of using a heel prevention boot to reduce the incidence of heel pressure ulcer across the care delivery chain was used. Totally 183 patients participated. The settings for the study were five ambulance stations, two emergency departments and 16 wards at two hospitals in Sweden. Results: A total of 39 individual patients (21 %) developed heel pressure ulcer at different stages across the care delivery chain. Findings revealed that 47-64 % of the patients were assessed as being at risk for developing heel pressure ulcer. Preventive action was taken. However, all patients who developed pressure ulcer during the care delivery chain did not receive adequate pressure ulcer prevention actions during their hospital stay. Discussion and Conclusions: In the ambulance and at the emergency department, skin inspection seems to be appropriate for preventing pressure ulcer. However, carrying out risk assessment with a validated instrument is of significant importance at the ward level. This would also be an appropriate level of resource use. Context-specific actions for pressure ulcer prevention should be incorporated into the care of the patient from the very beginning of the care delivery chain. },

   abstract = {In this article, we present a study of teachers’ experiences, specifically their own perception of their work over time with deaf and hard-of-hearing (DHH) pupils, in both Finland and Sweden. Teachers of DHH pupils are a minority amongst teachers in general, and also amongst special education teachers, because the number of DHH pupils is small. There seems to be a lack of research on experienced teachers’ own perspectives on their practice, their role and experience over time in teaching DHH pupils. The aim of our research is thus to shed light on the work career of experienced educators of DHH pupils and on the main changes in it. In order to understand the current situation of DHH education which is realised mainly in mainstream education today, we need to know its history as well. The research questions are formed as following: 1) What are the main issues that teachers bring up? 2) What elements are there in the teachers’ stories from different decades? A third minor interest is to determine whether the Finnish and Swedish teachers’ stories about their work differ. The narrative approach was chosen here to illustrate teachers’ experiences.  },

   abstract = {We study the homogenization of a reaction-diffusion-convection system posed in an epsilon-periodic delta-thin layer made of a two-component (solid-air) composite material. The microscopic system includes heat flow, diffusion and convection coupled with a nonlinear surface chemical reaction. We treat two distinct asymptotic scenarios: (1) For a fixed width delta &gt; 0 of the thin layer, we homogenize the presence of the microstructures (the classical periodic homogenization limit epsilon --&gt; 0); (2) In the homogenized problem, we pass to delta --&gt; 0 (the vanishing limit of the layer's width). In this way, we are preparing the stage for the simultaneous homogenization (epsilon --&gt; 0) and dimension reduction limit (delta --&gt; 0) with delta = delta (epsilon). We recover the reduced macroscopic equations from [25] with precise formulas for the effective transport and reaction coefficients. We complement the analytical results with a few simulations of a case study in smoldering combustion. The chosen multiscale scenario is relevant for a large variety of practical applications ranging from the forecast of the response to fire of refractory concrete, the microstructure design of resistance-to-heat ceramic-based materials for engines, to the smoldering combustion of thin porous samples under microgravity conditions. },

The medium in question consists of a connected matrix with disconnected, initially periodically distributed inclusions separated by a sharp interface undergoing an a prioriknown interface movement because of phase transformations. After transforming the moving geometry to an ϵ-periodic, fixed reference domain, we establish the well-posedness of the model and derive a number of ϵ-independent a priori estimates.

   abstract = {This study connects to gender issues within the field of science and technology. Women who had started strongly male-dominated engineering educations at Karlstad University were interviewed to find out why they had chosen these programs. A very clear picture emerged about the professions of the women’s fathers. Almost all fathers were engineers or employed in positions that required skills in technology. The women described their fathers as the most important person who had introduced them into the traditionally masculine technology world during childhood. Also other male relatives had influenced the women often in the same way as fathers had done. Mothers had encouraged their daughters for further studies, but not necessarily in the field of science and technology. Mathematics had often been the gateway to studies in science and technology. Thus, these women started early on a trajectory into a technical career. It is discussed if only girls with this strong masculine models and influences can enjoy settings with male norms or if these norms ought to be changed. Results from this study show that it is important to early influence young girls to opportunities that will stimulate their interests in science and technology. Â© 2013 HKIEd APFSLT. },

   abstract = {Lately, the concept of 'resistance' has gained considerable traction as a tool for critically exploring subaltern practices in relation to power. Few researchers, however, have elaborated on the inter-linkage of shifting forms of resistance; and above all, how acts of everyday resistance entangle with more organized and sometimes mass-based resistance activities. In this paper, these entanglements are analysed by taking into consideration the connections between articulations of resistance and technologies of power. Empirical observations from Cambodia are theorized in order to provide better theoretical tools for searching and investigating the inter-linkage between different resistance forms that contribute to social change. In addition, it is argued that modalities of power and its related resistance must be understood, or theorized, in relation to the concepts of 'agency', 'self-reflexivity' and 'techniques of the self'. },

Eye tracking, a visual method of data collection and analysis, was utilised to precisely monitor students’ eye movements while observing geography textbook spreads. In an exploratory study utilising random sampling, the eye movements of 20 students (secondary school students 15–17 years of age and university students 20–24 years of age) were recorded. The research entities were double-page spreads of current German geography textbooks covering an identical topic, taken from five separate textbooks. A two-stage test was developed. Each participant was given the task of first looking at the entire textbook spread to determine what was being explained on the pages. In the second stage, participants solved one of the tasks from the exercise section. Overall, each participant studied five different textbook spreads and completed five set tasks. After the eye tracking study, each participant completed a questionnaire. The results may verify textbook design as one crucial factor for successful knowledge acquisition from textbooks. Based on the eye tracking documentation, learning-related challenges posed by images and complex image-text structures in textbooks are elucidated and related to educational psychology insights and findings from visual communication and textbook analysis. },

   abstract = {This article provides a Bourdieusian analysis of the mediatized lifeworlds of so-called elite cosmopolitans. Based on interviews with Nordic expatriates employed by United Nations organizations in Geneva, the study looks at how the increasing dependence on new media influences the field of United Nations organizations and the trajectories of cosmopolitan subjects. Theoretically, the analysis builds on two key concepts: communicational doxa, which establishes a link between Bourdieu's field theory and critical mediatization theory; and cosmopolitan capital, understood as a sub-form of cultural capital. The findings suggest that mediatization alters the social conditions for accumulating cosmopolitan capital. However, the appropriation and mastery of new media do not hold any symbolic value as such, but tend to expand the possibilities for making investments in the field without altering its overarching logic. It is also shown that new professional media habits are often interwoven with private communication and the emotional needs associated with highly mobile family lives, thus underlining the indirect nature of mediatization in this context. },

The concept is introduced and the relationship between “history�? and “use�? is investigated further from a phenomenological perspective. Use of history is conceptualized as how people actively use the historical culture available to them. Through communication, they explain, build, and transform identities and societies. It is also suggested that use of history is a 3rd aim for history education. In addition to supporting students’ content knowledge and abilities to think historically, this article advocates the need to identify and analyze the role and function of history in contemporary life as an aspect of learning histor },

Den handledning som förekommer i en utbildning beskrivs som ett sätt att stödja och uppmuntra studenterna i deras lärande (Croninger &amp; Lee, 2001), men även handledaren är lärande i handledningssituationen (Anderse�?n, Berglund &amp; Gustavsson, kommande). I artikeln beskriver vi handledningssituationer som berättas i tal eller skrift av handledare, och analyserar de lärar-/handledningsidentiteter som framträder i berättelserna. Vi utgår från ett socialkonstruktionistiskt perspektiv på berättande (Goodson, Biesta, Tedder, &amp; Adair, 2010; Mishler, 1999) där handledarnas narrativa reflektioner kring sina berättelser (Freeman, 2010) har en avgörande roll i rekonstruktionen av handledningssituationen. Handledare i vår studie är lärarutbildare på gymnasiala yrkesprogram som handleder inom verksamhetsförlagd utbildning (VFU), högskolelärare som arbetar med handledningsmodellen Reflekterande Handledning i Omvårdnad (RHiO) inom sjuksköterskeprogrammet samt yrkeslärare som handleder elever inom de gymnasiala yrkesprogrammen. De som blir handledda är följaktligen universitetsstudenter (yrkeslärar- och sjuksköterskestudenter) och yrkeselever. Omgivningen varierar beroende på yrkesutbildning, men är exempelvis för yrkeslärarna gymnasieskolor och deras gymnasielever. Studien visar att de lärar-/handledaridentiteter som framträder ur lärarnas/handledarnas berättelser om deras handledningsarbete handlar om handledare som mentor och förebild, handledare som reflekterande samtalspartner samt handledare som bedömare och kontrollant. Dessutom visar studien att lärarna/handledarna främst positionerar sig gentemot de studenter de handleder, men också att den som bli handledd kan positionera sig i förhållande till sin egen handledare.  },

   abstract = {In 2009 the German Federal Constitutional Court introduced the principle of “public nature of elections�? (Federal Constitutional Court of Germany, March 2009). This principle requires that when using electronic voting systems it must be possible for the citizen to verify the essential steps in the election process and in the ascertainment of the results reliably and without special expert knowledge. Unfortunately, none of the existing systems complies with this principle. As a result, the use of electronic voting systems in Germany for parliamentary elections has stopped. Nevertheless, electronic voting systems are necessary and would improve the situation, especially for elections with complex ballots and voting rules, for example some local elections in Germany or parliamentary elections in Belgium and Luxembourg. The concept proposed by Volkamer et&amp;nbsp;al. (Volkamer et&amp;nbsp;al., 2011) was analyzed by a legal expert and evaluated to comply with the German legal requirements for local elections in the state of Hesse (Henning et&amp;nbsp;al., 2012). In this paper we specify and concretize processes that were left open in the concept, and implement a prototype. We evaluated this prototype in a user study that was conducted alongside the university elections at the Technische Universtität Darmstadt in June 2013. The results of the study show that most of the participants were satisfied with the prototype and would support its use for the upcoming university elections. We also report some lessons learned. },

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Previous studies have mainly compared professionals' and patient's ratings of the importance of different care aspects, finding poor agreement between the groups concerning patient-centered quality of care. There is still little known about the professionals' knowledge of how patients' experience the quality of care they receive during in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatments. The aim of this study was to investigate how IVF health care professionals estimate patients' experience of patient-centered quality of care and if certain factors influenced the IVF professionals' perceptions and IVF patients' experience of quality of care.MATERIAL AND METHODS: All 16 IVF public and private clinics in Sweden participated in this cross sectional study. A total of 268 IVF health care professionals and 3298 patients (women and men) undergoing IVF treatment between January and May 2015 participated by answering the validated questionnaire "Quality from the patient's perspective of in vitro fertilization treatment" (QPP-IVF).RESULTS: Healthcare professionals significantly underestimated patients' satisfaction with the patient-centered quality of care they received in all aspects measured. Both patients and professionals rated the most deficient factors to be 'responsibility/continuity', 'participation' and 'availability'. Healthcare professionals and patients belonging to private clinics evaluated patient-centered care as significantly better than professionals and patients at public clinics in almost all aspects measured.CONCLUSION: The results of this study will increase the professionals understanding of the patients' experiences during IVF treatment and provide additional knowledge when identifying areas to prioritize in order to improve quality of care. },

The study is largely based on calculations from literature data, but key stages are also tested experimentally. It is concluded that a kraft pulp mill can supply the acid demands of the viscose plant via acetic acid formed in the prehydrolysis and sulphuric acid for coagulation, with alkali for mercerization and dissolution, and it can also take care of spent liquors from the viscose plant. The pulp used for regenerated cellulose manufacture is delivered as wet pulp from the pulp mill, no drying is needed and a considerable amount of energy is saved. However, in an integrated production the viscose mill cannot use the whole production of cellulose from the kraft mill. One method of removing zinc ions from the coagulation bath effluents, based on precipitation of zinc sulphide via a well-controlled addition of green liquor from the pulp mill, has been studied. },

In light of an intercultural approach to this question, it seems most fruitful to define Nordic literature as a site of interplay between plural, converging, but also seemingly contradictory regions of identity, a site of continuous change but, most importantly, of human agency, intercultural dialogue and ‘our ability to go beyond the limits set by our existing beliefs and practices’ (Callinicos 2006, p.243). },

When combined, they can develop into insurmountable obstacles. The use of music interventions and activities to overcome some of these obstacles is explored in this article, using two cases of young First Nations people diagnosed with autism, in British Columbia, Canada. Although there are similarities, the differences in severity of ASD, place of residence and school situation, to mention a few factors, make a huge difference in their daily lives. Their contrasting possibilities to be present and participate in society may have implications for their social inclusion in adulthood. Results show that both traditional and contemporary music interventions can provide foundations for inclusion and they need to be carefully designed for each individual. },

   abstract = {Previous studies of intimidation and harassment of journalists have (rightly) focused on non-democratic and authoritarian nations and/or transitional/emerging democracies. In this article, we examine the situation in Sweden, a country with strong de facto and de jure safeguards of journalistic freedom and autonomy. We report the findings from a representative survey of Swedish journalists where three themes are analysed: the extent of harassment, the forms of harassment, and the consequences of intimidation and harassment. The results show that a third of the respondents had experienced threats at work in the past year, and an overwhelming majority said they had received offensive and insulting comments. Intimidation and harassment also had consequences, both professionally and personally, such as fear and self-censorship. We therefore argue that it is time to add the dimension of external pressure and threats to the discussion of journalistic autonomy—including in countries like Sweden. },

   abstract = {This article concerns singing education in folk music, Western classical tradition and improvised music in a music teacher education programme in Sweden. The study investigates how conditions for bodily learning and interpretation are semiotically designed and carried out by vocal teachers in one-to-one singing lessons. Video documentations of singing lessons with three vocal teachers and three students are transcribed and analysed with focus on how musical knowledge and practices of knowledge are bodily represented, designed and expressed, and how students respond to the teachers’ affordances. The theoretical point of view is based on a multimodal and social semiotic perspective. The result shows that all students have the possibility to learn the studied music through bodily understanding, expressions, associations, contextualisation, and interaction, yet the function and the meaning of these bodily learning aspects are varied in the studied lessons. The views of what is counted as musical knowledge, which norms and values are focused on, and which attitudes and methods the teachers work with thus vary depending on context and genre. New knowledge about bodily learning processes and bodily musical meaning making is contributed by the study.

   abstract = {The aim of this article is to investigate interferences between gender, class, sexuality, and ethnicity among international students by looking at migration patterns and living conditions of international master and PhD-students at three Swedish universities (Luleå University of Technology (LTU), Linköping University (LiU), The Royal Institute of Technology (KTH)). The experiences of these students with regard to transnationalism, higher education and research is a point of departure for discussing global stratification and transformation in the contemporary neoliberal knowledge economy. The article interprets the transnational flows of higher education in relation to a critical understanding of knowledge society and higher education by introducing the notion of eduscapes. This concept refers to the contemporary transnational flow of ideas and people with regard to higher education, and where nodes of knowledge centres and peripheries shift over time but are connected through modern communication technologies and different epistemic, ethnic, and student communities. In the transnational practices of higher education where students travel the globe in search and dreams of knowledge, a better life and future career possibilities, routes and imaginaries to a large extent reproduce and follow geopolitical power patterns. In this respect education by going global is shrinking the world but also stratifies, creating new patterns of inequality and competition. },

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Acquiring knowledge and experience on high-energy trauma is often difficult due to infrequent exposure. This creates a need for training which is specifically tailored for complex prehospital conditions. Simulation provides an opportunity for ambulance nurses to focus on the actual problems in clinical practice and to develop knowledge regarding trauma care. The aim of this study was to describe what ambulance nurses and paramedics in prehospital emergency care perceive as important for learning when participating in simulation exercises. METHODS: An integrative literature review was carried out. Criteria for inclusion were primary qualitative and quantitative studies, where research participants were ambulance nurses or paramedics, working within prehospital care settings, and where the research interventions involved simulation. RESULTS: It was perceived important for the ambulance nurses' learning that scenarios were advanced and possible to simulate repeatedly. The repetitions contributed to increase the level of experience, which in turn improved the patients care. Moreover, realism in the simulation and being able to interact and communicate with the patient were perceived as important aspects, as was debriefing, which enabled the enhancement of knowledge and skills. The result is presented in the following categories: To gain experience, To gain practice and To be strengthened by others. CONCLUSION: Learning through simulation does not require years of exposure to accident scenes. The simulated learning is enhanced by realistic, stressful scenarios where ambulance nurses interact with the patients. In this study, being able to communicate with the patient was highlighted as a positive contribution to learning. However, this has seldom been mentioned in a previous research on simulation. Debriefing is important for learning as it enables scrutiny of one's actions and thereby the possibility to improve and adjust one's caring. The effect of simulation exercises is important on patient outcome. },

   abstract = {Online communication is often presented in research as offering ways for young people to explore various forms of masculinity and femininity, which, in turn, could extend the notions of gendered identity. This paper explores how a Harry Potter fan fiction website can function as an online setting for gender identity construction among young fans. A positioning analysis of a small story told in an Internet Relay Chat (IRC) shows that although traditional gendered subject positions are explored and troubled in the story and its telling, heteronormativity prevails through the interpretative repertoires made available by the textual universe of Harry Potter. On the other hand, the positioning analysis of the small story activates an understanding of the interplay between the relational order among story characters and among the storytellers that can be seen as opening up a space between what is the told and the telling that allows the fans to experiment with aspects of gender identities that are related to power and control within an interpretative repertoire of heteronormativity. },

   abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to create knowledge about what factors explain the design of control systems for contracted public services. Design/methodology/approach - Questionnaire data analyzed with structural equation models. Findings - Legitimacy-seeking is the most important driver in explaining intensity in control of contracted public services. Competition increases the intensity of control which is opposite to standard transaction cost reasoning. Coordination requirements do not affect the design of control systems for contracted public services. Research limitations/implications - The study suffers from limitations in the form of the use of perception and questionnaire data and imposes restrictions on empirical generalization. Practical implications - Supplier competition may add control costs rather than lower them. The strong focus on stakeholder alignment may induce more intensive control than necessary for supplier alignment. Originality/value - The authors add important knowledge on the determinants of control system design for contracted public sector services. The authors conceptualize and measure the control system in use in a more compelling manner than previous research. },

Articles based on quantitative as well as qualitative researchmethods were included, resulting in a comprehensive overview of existing published research. For publishedarticles to be included in the review, the focus of the article had to be prehospital care providers, in prehospitalsettings. Furthermore, included articles must target interventions that were carried out in a simulation context.Results:The volume of published research is distributed between 1984- 2012 and across the regions North America,Europe, Oceania, Asia and Middle East. The simulation methods used were manikins, films, images or paper, live actors,animals and virtual reality. The staff categories focused upon were paramedics, emergency medical technicians (EMTs),medical doctors (MDs), nurse and fire fighters. The main topics of published research on simulation with prehospitalcare providers included: Intubation, Trauma care, Cardiac Pulmonary Resuscitation (CPR), Ventilation and Triage.Conclusion:Simulation were described as a positive training and education method for prehospital medical staff. Itprovides opportunities to train assessment, treatment and implementation of procedures and devices under realisticconditions. It is crucial that the staff are familiar with and trained on the identified topics, i.e., intubation, trauma care,CPR, ventilation and triage, which all, to a very large degree, constitute prehospital care. Simulation plays an integralrole in this. The current state of prehospital care, which this review reveals, includes inadequate skills of prehospital staffregarding ventilation and CPR, on both children and adults, the lack of skills in paediatric resuscitation and the lack ofknowledge in assessing and managing burns victims. These circumstances suggest critical areas for further training andresearch, at both local and global levels },

   abstract = {In this article we focus on the role of texts as material objects in the interaction between a teacher and her students in Swedish grade nine, working with critical reading of argumentative texts. With a Conversation Analysis approach, we investigate how texts are used as material objects in the organization of interaction between students and their teacher, as well as between students during group work. We also discuss what pedagogical implications the role of texts as material objects have for dialogicity in critical reading instruction. The result shows that texts as material objects are vital for the organization of interaction as they are used as resources in negotiating responsibility and primacy as well as for the distribution of turns between participants and to accomplish a representation of the answer to a reading task. A conclusion is that an intention to support dialogicity in reading instruction requires awareness of how dialogic and critical aspects of reading easily become subordinated to the aim of problem solving in classrooms as task work is organized around texts that are also material objects. },

Nutid, dåtid och framtid behöver omförhandlas i ett nytt socialt sammanhang för att (åter-)skapa mening och därmed fortsätta intrigen i livsberättelsen. Vi vill undersöka hur integration och etablering kan förstås som en meningsskapande process och vad ett sådant perspektiv innebär för förståelsen för mötet mellan nyanländ och policy. Har vi en etableringsprocess som ger individen verktyg för att skapa minnen av en ny framtid? },

   abstract = {Passage of fish through hydropower dams is associated with mortality, delay, increased energy expenditure and migratory failure for migrating fish and the need for remedial measures for both upstream and downstream migration is widely recognised. A functional fish passage must ensure safe and timely passage routes that a substantial portion of migrating fish will use. Passage solutions must address not only the number or percentage of fish that successfully pass a barrier, but also the time it takes to pass. Here, we used radiotelemetry to study the functionality of a fish bypass for downstream-migrating wild-caught and hatchery-released Atlantic salmon smolts. We used time-to-event analysis to model the influence of fish characteristics and environmental variables on the rates of a series of events associated with dam passage. Among the modelled events were approach rate to the bypass entry zone, retention rates in both the forebay and the entry zone and passage rates. Despite repeated attempts, only 65% of the tagged fish present in the forebay passed the dam. Fish passed via the bypass (33%), via spill (18%) and via turbines (15%). Discharge was positively related to approach, passage and retention rates. We did not detect any differences between wild and hatchery fish. Even though individual fish visited the forebay and the entry zone on multiple occasions, most fish passed during the first exposures to these zones. This study underscores the importance of timeliness to passage success and the usefulness of time-to-event analysis for understanding factors governing passage performance. },

This trend of “non-religious�? or “therapeutic�? Buddhism seems to be of major importance when considering the impact Buddhism has had on the majority populations. Mindfulness-based therapies have been introduced by a handful of Swedish medical proponents (authors, doctors, educational in- stitutions and individual therapists) who have facilitated their use within the health care system. Out- side clinical settings, a wide range of institutions offer courses in mindfulness as a general life skill. Some of these also are aimed at medical professionals. The article asks whether mindfulness based therapies, viewed as knowledge capital, can have a bridging capacity or linking character, and ends with a discussion of the potential challenges involved when mindfulness is promoted as something that can be taught, and sold, as a commodity. },

Such existentially oriented aspects of globalization are still relatively underresearched. It is argued that cultural studies hold a responsibility to carry out ethnographically oriented analyses of mobile elite groups in order to unveil the complexities of life trajectories commonly associated with social as well as economic success. The article outlines an epistemological platform for carrying out such analyses, combining the new mobilities paradigm with social field theory and social phenomenology. Based on the empirical analyses presented in the Special Issue, the article also introduces three registers of ambiguity and negotiation': ambiguities of moral geographies, ambiguities of re-embedding and ambiguities of flow-architectures. },

The paper explores parents’ narratives of preschool choice as moral claims of parental identities. The analysed data are based on a study of how parents make sense of their preschool choice during life-story interviews. Our results point out good parenting as having to do with making distinctions between what is ‘good and bad’ and ‘right and wrong’ regardless of whether the choices concern preschools or the behaviour of preschool teachers and parents. Culturally available discourses become visible through the making of these distinctions in ways that ultimately point to the subject position of parents as particular choosers as related to a prevailing discourse of parental responsibility. },

   abstract = {Australia is a country of high linguistic diversity, with more than 300 languages spoken. Today, 19% of the population aged over 5 years speak a language other than English at home. Against this background, we examine government policies and prominent initiatives developed at national level in the past 30 years to address the challenge of offering 'Literacy for all', in particular focusing on minority language speaking children. Across the examined policies and initiatives, a distinct negative correlation can be observed: the more multilingual Australia has become, the more assimilationist the policies, and the more monolingual the orientation of the society that governments have sought to establish through policy. We argue that to enhance literacy outcomes more generally, this orientation needs to be reversed. We explain why policy understanding and approach need to instead promote the maintenance of home languages and support literacy acquisition in these languages. },

   abstract = {Requirements Engineering (RE) has received much attention in research andpractice due to its importance to software project success. Its interdisciplinary nature, thedependency to the customer, and its inherent uncertainty still render the discipline diffi-cult to investigate. This results in a lack of empirical data. These are necessary, however, todemonstrate which practically relevant RE problems exist and to what extent they matter.Motivated by this situation, we initiated the Naming the Pain in Requirements Engineer-ing (NaPiRE) initiative which constitutes a globally distributed, bi-yearly replicated family of surveys on the status quo and problems in practical RE. In this article, we report on thequalitative analysis of data obtained from 228 companies working in 10 countries in variousdomains and we reveal which contemporary problems practitioners encounter. To this end,we analyse 21 problems derived from the literature with respect to their relevance and crit-icality in dependency to their context, and we complement this picture with a cause-effectanalysis showing the causes and effects surrounding the most critical problems. Our resultsgive us a better understanding of which problems exist and how they manifest themselvesin practical environments. Thus, we provide a first step to ground contributions to RE onempirical observations which, until now, were dominated by conventional wisdom only. },

   abstract = {Friction is a fundamental phenomenon in tribology involving complex mechanisms between thecontacting surfaces. Measurements of friction are often made using devices with substantially largercontact area than dimensions corresponding to microstructural features of the materials. Hence, for multi-phase materials,influence of particular microstructural constituents is not resolved. In the present work, a tribometerwith a contact area in the nano-scale range was used to map friction for different types of tool steelswith different chemical- and phase composition. Owing to the small tip radius, frictionalcharacteristics of primary carbides and the steel matrix were measured and compared. Dependingon chemical composition, a difference was observed where the coefficient of friction wasapproximately twice higher for the steel possessing highest coefficient of friction, including bothcarbides and the steel matrix. },

In this article, we examine in detail the interplay between a teacher and her students when they talk about argumentative texts in a Swedish ninth grade classroom setting. In the analysis we combine a Conversation Analysis ap-proach with reading theories that emphasize the dialogical encounter between reader and text. Our result indicates the dual nature of the teaching perspective which sometimes involves conflicting aims. The teacher has to choose between intervening in response to student reactions that reflect emotional and stereotypical attitudes that may hinder a critical reading, or intervening to make use of and stimu-late reactions that may lead to more critical readings. Thus, our study emphasizes that it is crucial that teachers are able to both manage the leadership in the complex classroom interaction, and to apply knowledge about reading processes and strategies that students get involved in when they discuss en-gaging texts in school. },

This paper presents NEAT, a user-space library that can provide an alternate transport API. NEAT allows applications to request the service they need using a new design that is agnostic to the specific choice of transport protocol underneath. This not only allows applications to take advantage of common protocol machinery, but also eases introduction of new network mechanisms and transport protocols. The paper describes the components of the NEAT library and illustrates the important benefits that can be gained from this new approach. NEAT is a software platform for developing advanced network applications that was designed in accordance with the standardization efforts on Transport Services (TAPS) in the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), but its features exceed the envisioned functionality of a TAPS system.  },

   abstract = {This article examines the role of support mechanisms for new migrant communities provided by networks of statutory, third-sector and refugee community organisations. The article explores the dynamics of the relationships between support groups, with analysis located in the urban context of NorthTown. The findings point to the possibility of tension between migrant support groups where there is a perceived need to compete over resources or political influence. Moreover, it is argued that there is a risk that institutional goals of organisational sustainability may take precedence over substantive goals of support provision. The ability of support groups to assert agency in terms of strategic responses to structural constraints on sustainability is explored. It is argued that an organising logic based on the creation of a political community within the new migrant population can prove more sustainable than contingent communities based on commonalities of language or nationality. },

By definition, a ring is a set in R2 obtained by subtracting a compact convex set with polygonal boundary from another such a set, but without creating uncontrollably narrow elongated subregions. Nested structure of the rings is not assumed; however, uniform boundedness of the eccentricities of the underlying convex sets is required. It is also assumed that the splines have maximum smoothness. Bernstein type inequalities for this sort of splines are proved that allow us to establish sharp inverse estimates in terms of Besov spaces. },

   abstract = {The memorability of PINs is an enduring security issue. This is especially pertinent in the context of banking, where technical systems evolve more slowly than in other contexts (e.g. many mobile phone operating systems have adopted alternative authentication mechanisms). Banking customers who struggle to memorise all their PINs often record them, sometimes insecurely, flying in the face of advice from their banks. Banks respond to memorisation difficulties by permitting customers to change their PINs. The reality is that both recording and changing unwittingly weakens the mechanism by increasing predictability. Yet trying to forbid these coping strategies is futile. It is far better to acknowledge the prevalence of such behaviours and to try to nudge people towards more secure PIN management. In this paper, we suggest a way of achieving this. },

   abstract = {Introduction: Simulation creates the possibility to experience acute situations during nursing education which cannot easily be achieved in clinical settings. Aim: To describe how nursing students learn acute care of patients through simulation exercises, based on observation and debriefing. Design: The study was designed as an observational study inspired by an ethnographic approach.MethodData was collected through observations and interviews. Data was analyzed using an interpretive qualitative content analysis.Results: Nursing students created space for reflection when needed. There was a positive learning situation when suitable patient scenarios were presented. Observations and discussions with peers gave the students opportunities to identify their own need for knowledge, while also identifying existing knowledge. Reflections could confirm or reject their preparedness for clinical practice. The importance of working in a structured manner in acute care situations became apparent. However, negative feedback to peers was avoided, which led to a loss of learning opportunity.Conclusion: High fidelity simulation training as a method plays an important part in the nursing students' learning. The teacher also plays a key role by asking difficult questions and guiding students towards accurate knowledge. This makes it possible for the students to close knowledge gaps, leading to improved patient safety. },

   abstract = {The current Swedish curricula for compulsory school (Lgr11) emphasize inquiry-based science teaching to develop pupils’ critical thinking while the Swedish laboratory teaching tradition emphasize laboratory work to gain students conceptual understanding. The aim of this study is to illuminate how a group of teachers within the Swedish teaching tradition, based on the prevailing condition, met the external expectations of involving pupils in inquiry-based science teaching. During a teacher professional development program, the entire group of lower secondary science teachers within a school district, twelve in total, participated in group reflections about own inquiry activities. The results indicated that teachers, despite shortage of activates, wanted to involve pupils in inquiry-based science teaching to meet the curricula’s’ and national tests’ request for such activities. The teachers did this through hybridization, in which the teachers opened up and transformed existing laboratory activities; and by imitation, in which they imitated how investigative inquiry is carried out on national tests. Inquiry-based science teaching, as it emerges in this study, possessed several characteristics might limiting the potential for pupils to develop an understanding functional for critical thinking in private- and public lives.  },

   abstract = {Background: The aim was to investigate trends in the prevalence of obesity by age and level of education in the general population in mid-Sweden from year 2000 to 2012. Methods: A postal questionnaire was sent to a random population sample aged 25-74 years in years 2000, 2004, 2008 and 2012. The overall response rates were 67%, 65%, 60% and 53%, respectively, and the study included 29 017, 27 385, 25 910 and 24 152 respondents, respectively. Obesity (BMI a parts per thousand yen 30 kg/m(2)) was based on self-reported weight and height. Results: The age-standardized prevalence of obesity increased from 13% to 17% in women and from 12% to 17% in men between 2000 and 2012. Obesity increased in all age groups from 2000 to 2008 and continued to increase among the middle aged (45-64 years) between 2008 and 2012. The socioeconomic gradient in obesity changed during the study period since the absolute increase in obesity was steepest at the middle educational level. In 2012, the prevalence of obesity was almost twice as high at both middle and low educational levels compared with high educational level. The 'true' prevalence of adult obesity, corrected for self-reported weight and height, was around 20% in 2012 for both men and women. Conclusion: In the majority, among the middle-aged and those with secondary education, the prevalence of obesity continued to increase even between 2008 and 2012. },

   abstract = {AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To explore healthy older patients' perceptions of their own capacity to regain pre-fracture function in the acute phase following hip fracture surgery. BACKGROUND: The incidence of hip fractures is expected to increase. In Sweden, of the patients who sustain a hip fracture, 40 per cent are healthy and lived independently pre fracture. However, a hip fracture often results in declined functional outcomes for 40 per cent of these patients. DESIGN: The study had an explorative inductive qualitative design. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews (n = 30) were conducted two to five days after hip fracture surgery. Data were analysed using manifest inductive content analysis. RESULTS: As a description of patients' perception of their own capacity to regain pre-fracture function after a hip fracture, one main category emerged: To end up in a new situation with or without control. Patients expressed that they believed in recovery and thought nothing would be altered. However, since they had to adapt to the ward culture at the acute hospital, they became passive and became insecure about their future life situation. CONCLUSION: The attitudes of staff at the acute hospital can influence the outcome for hip fracture patients. Patients believe in recovery but do not receive psychological support to regain physical capacity. },

   abstract = {This paper discusses how religious education can address the aspects of religion that transcend the limits of verbal communication. It draws on empirical data from group interviews with young Norwegian members of the Catholic and Lutheran Churches. The young informants reflect on aspects of religion that seem to exceed the limits of language and suggest that how religious education deals with these elements needs to be improved if it is to promote respect and understanding for religion and believers. Excerpts from the material are discussed in the light of theological and philosophical perspectives on the unsayable. Finally, possible pedagogical approaches to facilitate the understanding of and dealing with the handling of non-verbal aspects of religious faith are explored, including the use of philosophical perspectives, experiences from art and music and empirical descriptions of religious experience. },

   abstract = {The aim of this study is to examine the strategies majority language-speaking parents use to support the development of the minority language in families who follow the pattern of exposure known as one-parent-one-language (OPOL). In this particular pattern of raising a child bilingually, each parent speaks only their own native language to their children. Previous studies concerned with language development in children raised under the OPOL pattern primarily focused on how input from the minority language-speaking parent affects minority language development, leaving the role of the majority language-speaking parent largely unexplored. To address this gap, a case study was carried out on three families in Brisbane, Australia, who reported following the OPOL pattern. Video and audio recordings were taken, along with interviews using an elicited recall task based on the recordings to gather data on the families' language practices and motivations. The results of the qualitative analysis suggest that, in these families, the majority language-speaking parent plays an important role that extends beyond the provision of input in the majority language and may contribute to fostering minority language development and maintenance. },

   abstract = {In this study, the extraction and CE-ESI-TOF-MS analysis of tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) drugs imipramine, desipramine, clomipramine and norclomipramine in human plasma has been optimized. The CE capillaries were modified with omega-iodo-alkyl ammonium salt (M7C4I coating) to reduce analyte adsorption to the silica wall. The use of a strong cation exchange (SCX) solid-phase extraction (SPE) column specifically designed for the extraction of basic drug species from biofluids gave very clean extracts with high and reproducible recoveries. The extraction recoveries were ranging between 87 and 91% with % RSD values of 0.5-1.7% (n = 3). The obtained strong cation exchange-SPE extracts of the TCA in human plasma only contained the analytes of interest. The optimized CE separation conditions were obtained by adding ACN and acetic acid to the sample while using an aqueous BGE. The CE-ESI-TOF-MS analysis was performed within 6 min for all TCA analytes under the optimized condition with peak efficiencies up to 1.4 x 10(5) plates/m and an average % RSD of the migration times of the analytes of 0.3% (n = 5). The presented method can readily be used for the extraction and quantification of basic drug species in human biological fluids and in pharmaceutical formulations. },

These exercise television games often contain references to physical activities carried out in different outdoor landscapes. The purpose of this article is to examine the views of landscape and nature offered by the games and the consequences this may have for students' relationships with nature and future environmental commitment. The methodological approach used is companion meaning analysis: the meaning of nature that follows when playing the games. The results show a controlled landscape that is perfectly arranged for the activity (functional specialisation). It is an obvious anthropocentric base and commands an instrumental value where nature is valuable because it satisfies our felt preferences (demand value). Exergames can thus be seen as a further step in an ongoing detachment process from the physical landscape (indoorisation). },

Finally, we review the essential aspects of our experimental setup and measurement technique. },

Parents were asked to rate the extent to which they experienced a set of specific fears related to their child's brain tumor and its treatment. Outcomes for parents of CNS tumor patients (n = 82) were compared with those of reference parents of patients treated for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (n = 208). The fears about an illness recurrence and the late effects of treatment were most prominent among parents of CNS tumor patients. For 7 out of 11 kinds of fear, parents of CNS tumor patients expressed a stronger fear than the reference group. More than a quarter of the parents of children treated for CNS tumors feared a complete decline of the child. Parents of CNS tumor patients experience relatively heightened cancer related fears in several domains. The fear of devastating consequences felt by one fourth of parents signals the need of individualized psychological support and information at diagnosis and follow-up to facilitate parental coping with the posttreatment situation. },

   abstract = {In supercritical fluid chromatography (SFC) the mobile phase comprises of carbon dioxide (CO2) as main solvent and smaller amounts of an organic polar solvent (often an alcohol) as co-solvent. The co-solvent is considered to function by changing the overall polarity of the eluent, i.e. by acting as a "modifier". However, recent studies indicate that the co-solvent methanol can also adsorb to some common SFC stationary phases. Hence, the co-solvent should also be able to function as an "adsorbing additive", i.e. an eluent component that competes with the injected solutes about the stationary phase surface. In this study it was found by fitting different mechanistic models to systematic experimental data, that the co-solvent methanol can have both functions: at low co-solvent fractions, methanol acts as an additive whereas at larger fractions it acts as a modifier. Moreover, it was found that when the co-solvent adsorbs more strongly to the stationary phase than the solute, "bizarre" deformations of the preparative band shapes can occur. This is illustrated by a solute that converts from a normal "Langmuirian" band shape to an "anti-Langmuirian" shape when changing from neat carbon dioxide (CO2) to an eluent containing co-solvent. This peak shape transition is dependent on both (i) the relative retention of the solute and co-solvent to the stationary phase in eluent containing neat CO2 and on (ii) the relative retention of the additive perturbation peak and the solute peak in eluent containing also co-solvent.  },

   abstract = {Introduction Although the group of vascular leg amputated patients constitutes some of the most vulnerable and frail on the orthopedic wards, previous research of amputated patients has focused on patients attending gait training in rehabilitation facilities leaving the patient experience shortly after surgery unexplored. Understanding patients' behavior shortly after amputation could inform health professionals in regard to how these vulnerable patients' needs at hospital can be met as well as how to plan for care post-discharge. Aim To construct a grounded theory (GT) explaining patients' behavior shortly after having a leg amputated as a result of vascular disease. Method In line with constructivist GT methodology, data from ethnographic observations and interviews were simultaneously collected and analyzed using the constant comparative method covering the patients' experiences during the first 4 weeks post-surgery. Data collection was guided by theoretical sampling and comprised 11 patients. A GT was constructed. Results Patients went through a three-phased process as they realized they were experiencing a life-changing event. The first phase was "Losing control" and comprised the sub-categories "Being overwhelmed" and "Facing dependency." The second phase was "Digesting the shock" and comprised the sub-categories "Swallowing the life-changing decision," "Detecting the amputated body" and "Struggling dualism." The third phase was "Regaining control" and comprised the sub-categories "Managing consequences" and "Building-up hope and self-motivation." "Pendulating" was identified as the core category describing the general pattern of behavior and illustrated how patients were swinging both cognitively and emotionally throughout the process. Conclusion The theory of "Pendulating" offers a tool to understand the amputated patients' behavior and underlying concerns and to recognize where they are in the process. Concepts from the theory could be used by health professionals who support patients coping with the situation by offering terms to express and recognize patients' reactions. },

It introduces the work of Shetland author James John Haldane Burgess (1862-1927) and the Orcadian author George Mackay Brown (1921-1996), evaluating in what ways both writers usse their geographically peripheral position as a unique vantage point from which to reframe Nordic literature. By re-orientating the Scottish Islands from the periphery of Britain to the centre of important scenes in Nordic history, the two authors construct a new sense of both geographical and cultural place. This approach allows the modern boundaries of the Nordic world to be extended, and for a new and complex third space to emerge, where the islands form a connection between the Nordic and Anglo-Celtic realms. },

We also consider the possibilities of using boron diffusion gettering in solar cell fabrication and discuss the role of boron and iron concentration in the optimization of gettering efficiency. },

   abstract = {Home language literacy education in Australia has been pursued predominantly through Community Language Schools. At present, some 1000 of these, attended by over 100,000 school-age children, cater for 69 of the over 300 languages spoken in Australia. Despite good intentions, these schools face a number of challenges. For instance, children may lack motivation and perceive after-hours schooling as an unnecessary burden. Trained teachers and suitable teaching materials are often not available. Moreover, not every language can be offered in each city or region. Hence, home language speakers’ needs are often not met. This situation has detrimental effects for children, families and communities, and entails a loss of opportunities for the country. Reporting on an alternative approach, this paper presents a pilot study conducted in Australia with English–German bilinguals. We sought to investigate whether primary school-aged children can self-direct their home language literacy acquisition through playing online educational games in the privacy of their homes and with little adult input. Results indicate that the games can be effective in promoting emergent literacy development. Thus, such a grassroots approach could become a viable option for multilingual societies, addressing some of the practical challenges faced by, for instance, Community Language Schools. },

Since habit strength is the most powerful predictor of news consumption, the goal is to not only engage news consumers, but also to provide a personalized news experience and to persuade users to foster the habit of consuming news regularly. However, there is a large research gap in the intersection of journalism and gamification. This article aims to discern how digital news media have introduced game mechanics into their online platforms, and the logic which it serves. This assessment is primarily based on four case studies of gamified news: The Guardian, The Times of India, Bleacher Report, and Al Jazeera. The results are ambivalent since the driving forces of the implementation process combine an attempt to engage users and a set of commercial motivations. },

Just as rhetoricians have situated the speech within the rhetorical situation, the literary text may productively be situated within what I call the literary situation. Literature thus conceived could be described as a process in which kairos - the opportunity to exploit the circumstances of the moment - is transferred from the writer to the reader.That such a theoretical point of departure provides us with a better opportunity to investigate the ideological dimension of literature is demonstrated through a reading of Rymmaren, the first novel by former Swedish Minister for Justice, Thomas Bodström. A political thriller largely set in the Governmental Offices, it was dismissed by critics as lacking literary value but sold well nevertheless. The novel thus is a concrete example of how ethos has gained importance at the expense of logos in contemporary literature. Its attraction does not depend upon how well Bodström writes, but upon who he is: as former minister, he can claim to provide an inside view of the scenes he depicts. While the novel shows Bodström being adept at using fiction for political purposes, it also exposes an ideological emptiness which suggests that politics in the 21st century has become a matter of simulation rather than representation. },

   abstract = {Distearoylphosphatidylcholine (DSPC)/cholesterol/distearoylphosphatidylethanolamine (DSPE)-polyethylene glycol 5000 [PEG(5000)] lipid disks, mimicking biological membranes, were used as pseudostationary phase in partial filling electrokinetic capillary chromatography (EKC) to study interactions between pharmaceuticals and lipid disks. Capillaries were coated either noncovalently with a poly(1-vinylpyrrolidone)-based copolymer or covalently with polyacrylamide to mask the negative charges of the fused-silica capillary wall and to minimize interactions between positively charged pharmaceuticals and capillary wall. Although the noncovalent copolymer coating method was faster, better stability of the covalent polyacrylamide coating at physiological pH 7.4 made it more reliable in partial filling EKC studies. Migration times of pharmaceuticals were proportional to the amount of lipids in the pseudostationary phase, and partition coefficients were successfully determined. Because the capillary coatings almost totally suppressed the electroosmotic flow, it was not practical to use the EKC-based method for partition studies involving large molecules with low mobilities. Hence, the applicability of the biomembrane mimicking lipid disks for interactions studies with large molecules was verified by the quartz crystal microbalance technique. Biotinylated lipid disks were then immobilized on streptavidincoated sensor chip surface, and interactions with a high-molecular-mass molecule, lysozyme, were studied. Cryo-transmission electron microscopy and asymmetrical flow field-flow fractionation were used to clarify the sizes of lipid disks used. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. },

   abstract = {Predicting the expected throughput of TCP is important for several aspects such as e.g. determining handover criteria for future multihomed mobile nodes or determining the expected throughput of a given MPTCP subflow for load-balancing reasons. However, this is challenging due to time varying behavior of the underlying network characteristics. In this paper, we present a genetic-algorithm-based prediction model for estimating TCP throughput values. Our approach tries to find the best matching combination of mathematical functions that approximate a given time series that accounts for the TCP throughput samples using genetic algorithm. Based on collected historical datapoints about measured TCP throughput samples, our algorithm estimates expected throughput over time. We evaluate the quality of the prediction using different selection and diversity strategies for creating new chromosomes. Also, we explore the use of different fitness functions in order to evaluate the goodness of a chromosome. The goal is to show how different tuning on the genetic algorithm may have an impact on the prediction. Using extensive simulations over several TCP throughput traces, we find that the genetic algorithm successfully finds reasonable matching mathematical functions that allow to describe the TCP sampled throughput values with good fidelity. We also explore the effectiveness of predicting time series throughput samples for a given prediction horizon and estimate the prediction error and confidence.  },

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Phthalates comprise a large class of chemicals used in a variety of consumer products. Several have anti-androgenic properties, and in rodents prenatal exposure has been associated with reduced anogenital distance (AGD)-the distance from the anus to the genitals in male offspring. Few human studies have been conducted, but associations between the anti-androgenic phthalates and male AGD have been reported. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to study the association between phthalate exposure in late pregnancy in Danish women pregnant in 2010-2012 and AGD in their male infants at 3 months of age (n = 273). METHODS: In the Odense child cohort study, urinary concentrations of 12 phthalate metabolites of diethyl, di-n-butyl, diisobutyl, di(2-ethylhexyl), butylbenzyl, and diisononyl phthalate (DEP, DnBP, DiBP, DEHP, BBzP, and DiNP, respectively) were measured among 245 mothers of boys at approximately gestational week 28 (range, 20.4-30.4) and adjusted for osmolality. AGD, penile width, and weight were measured 3 months after the expected date of birth. Associations between prenatal phthalate and AGD and penile width were estimated using multivariable linear regression adjusting for age and weight-for-age standard deviation score. RESULTS: Phthalate levels were lower in this population than in a recent Swedish study in which phthalates were measured in the first trimester. No consistent associations were seen between any prenatal phthalate and AGD or penile width. Most associations were negative for exposures above the first quartile, and for ln-transformed exposures modeled as continuous variables, but there were no consistent dose-response patterns, and associations were not statistically significant (p &gt; 0.05). CONCLUSION: We found no significant trends towards shorter AGD in boys with higher phthalates exposures in this low exposed Danish population. },

   abstract = {Objective: Several authors have suggested demands and requirements for teaching mindfulness and meditation. In the scientific literature there is however a lack of evaluation of mindfulness teachers and how to teach mindfulness meditation effectively. This study aims at providing deeper insight of the importance of the teachers in the field of mindfulness and meditation and it investigates how mindfulness and meditation teachers describe the prerequisites for teaching mindfulness and meditation. Method: The method of Thematic Analysis, TA, was utilized to analyse the data from semi-structured interviews conducted with twelve experienced teachers, from different mindfulness and meditation traditions. The participants are mindfulness and meditation teachers from either within the Buddhist, secular or both Buddhist and secular contexts. Results: The analysis resulted in three main themes and nine subthemes, such as for example the main theme; Teacher qualification with subthemes; Becoming teacher, Being teacher, Pedagogic skills and Social skills. The results suggest a flexible and pragmatic view on how mindfulness and meditation teaching should be provided. Instead of a fixed set of requirements for the teacher and the student, what makes mindfulness and meditation teaching effective has to do with the ability to recognize the potential in every unique situation with an understanding of the impermanent and interdependent relationship between teacher, student and context. Conclusion: Being and becoming a teacher is a continuous process and anyone can assume the role of mindfulness and meditation teacher. It is dependent on the students and the context. A formalized education is not a prerequisite but what is required is sufficient compassion and insight. For the teacher’s compassion and insight to ripen and for the student to learn, non-ideal conditions and suffering, is required and it is helpful with supportive fellow practitioners, teachers, especially if they themselves practice what they teach and share what they know. <img src="file:///page1image21032" /> },

Even though definitions of bullying and degrading treatment tend to lead to thoughts of school-age children rather than preschoolers, previous research shows that bullying occurs in preschool as well. Our data consist of documentation of improvement work carried out in the preschools that were analysed from both a peer culture perspective and a school improvement perspective. Our main results show that the preschools, by identifying challenges and actions anchored in the local context, ‘hit the target’ in their work against bullying and degrading treatment in the preschools. However, the children and their perspectives were rarely taken into account in the improvement work, which we consider as ‘missing the point’. Didactic implications for further preschool action learning projects are discussed. },

   abstract = {The aim of the present study was to explore preventive strategies and processes to counteract bullying in workplaces. Data were collected by individual interviews and focus group discussions at one hospital and two nursing home wards for elderly, a total of 29 participants. In the analysis of the interviews we were inspired by constructivist grounded theory. Persistent work with a humanistic value system by supervisor and coworkers, raising awareness about the bullying problem, strong group collaboration, and conflict management, along with an open atmosphere at the workplace, appears to be imperative for accomplishing a policy of zero tolerance for bullying. },

   abstract = {Inquiry- and context-based teaching strategies have been proven to stimulate and motivate students’ interests in learning science. In this study, 12 teachers reflected on these strategies after using them in primary schools. The teachers participated in a continuous professional development (CPD) programme. During the programme, they were also introduced to a teaching model from a European project, where inquiry- and context-based education (IC-BaSE) strategies were fused. The research question related to teachers’ reflections on these teaching strategies, and whether they found the model to be useful in primary schools after testing it with their students. Data collection was performed during the CPD programme and consisted of audio-recorded group discussions, individual portfolios and field notes collected by researchers. Results showed that compared with using only one instructional strategy, teachers found the new teaching model to be a useful complement. However, their discussions also showed that they did not reflect on choices of strategies or purposes and aims relating to students’ understanding, or the content to be taught. Before the CPD programme, teachers discussed the use of inquiry mainly from the aspect that students enjoy practical work. After the programme, they identified additional reasons for using inquiry and discussed the importance of knowing why inquiry is performed. However, to develop teachers’ knowledge of instructional strategies as well as purposes for using certain strategies, there is need for further investigations among primary school teachers. },

The aim of this study was to examine professionals' views of supporting relatives of persons with SMI. MATERIAL: Individual interviews mirroring personal narratives and group interviews reflecting group-processed answers were conducted among 23 professionals and analyzed thematically. RESULTS: Three themes emerged: (a) information and group interaction reduces stigma and increases well-being, (b) professionals need to feel secure and confident about how the support structure works and (c) collaboration is difficult but required on several levels. CONCLUSION: Trusting relationships with families were considered important, although seldom achieved; professionals wished to feel secure in their role toward relatives of a person with SMI; and professionals wanted to feel confident when working together with other services to support families. },

   abstract = {According to previous research, contemporary journalism is undergoing a quantitative turn. The uses of data and metrics have started to permeate digital news websites in various ways. However, there is a lack of research on how gamification is applied to journalism practice. This article examines how the quantification of news production, readers’ interactions, and use of game mechanics have started to permeate journalism practice in digital outlets. Methodologically, this article focuses on the sports news website Bleacher Report as case study, drawing data from an analysis of the gamified system in which journalists are quantified and rewarded with points and badges according to their writing metrics, and a set of interviews with journalists who work for Bleacher Report. The results show that while data and metrics become the main component to assess journalists’ capacities, the process of automated quantification and the competitive playfulness of leaderboards are perceived as motivating affordances. },

   abstract = {Despite the many historical links between literature and rhetoric, teachers of literature have made relatively few attempts to draw on rhetoric for teaching purposes. The present article suggests how this may be done, and argues for the pedagogical benefits of taking a rhetorical approach to literature. By means of a close reading of the first chapter of Nathaniel Hawthorne’s The Scarlet Letter, I demonstrate how a text may be systematically explored through the five steps (partes) of the classical rhetorical process. In conclusion, it suggests that rhetoric may be a means to bridge the gap between the many facets of English as a second language subject, as rhetoric provides a holistic framework allowing us to study literature and culture as language, and vice versa.  },

The relationship between Norway and the Northern Isles of Scotland during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, especially trading links, is considered using the bentwood box as a way of accessing both tangible and intangible knowledge. Different types of traditional wooden boxes from Shetland, Orkney, Norway, and Iceland are compared using a microhistorical approach, which enables us to consider Norway and Scotland both as individual “ethno-territories�? and as part of continuously changing networks of social and cultural contact across the North Atlantic. },

   keywords = {GEO-MEDIA, GEOGRAPHY EDUCATION, INTERPRETATION OF PHOTOS, MEDIA IMAGES, SEMIOTICS, VISUAL LITERACY},
   abstract = {As a new set of skills, geo-media tools and resources are being introduced in the Finnish comprehensive school curriculum, although an explicit definition of ‘geo-media’ is not given. In the Finnish upper secondary school curriculum, geo-media is described with one sentence. In this article, the concept of geo-media is approached with online questionnaires introduced to Finnish and international experts on geography education and geo-media (n=6) and Finnish geography teachers (n=22). Both groups tend to perceive geo-media as digital sources used in geography education. Yet, teachers think that geo-media will not change their teaching practices. In the literature, geo-media refer to all media that carry georeferenced information. Therefore, this paper introduces three visions of how geo-media can be understood as a broader concept; that is, geographical media literacy skills. The first example is (1) a photograph of ‘Reverend Billy’ with which the value of geolocative information is studied with the semiotic procedure of a ‘commutation test.’ The second example is (2) an advertisement by Diesel, in which geographical stereotypes are questioned with a semiotic process of the ‘transfer of meanings.’ The third example, (3) a Finnish cartoon strip ‘Viivi &amp; Wagner,’ highlights the role of global events when reading images from a geographical perspective. Although location plays a crucial role in all three of the examples, the experts and the teachers did not pay that much attention to the question of ‘where.’ In consequence, young people need to be competent in interpreting and evaluating the geographical content of visual re-presentations before producing geo-media presentations of their own. },

In particular, the paper explores resistance in terms of (re)categorizations from a historical and discursive–materialistic perspective. The field of resistance studies has mainly been preoccupied with entities such as texts, signs, symbols, identity, and language. In this article, however, we bring in physical and material entities in order to display the ways in which matter is of importance in the (re)construction of discourses and thereby for resistance. },

   abstract = {Latency is increasingly becoming a performance bottleneck for Internet Protocol (IP) networks, but historically, networks have been designed with aims of maximizing throughput and utilization. This paper offers a broad survey of techniques aimed at tackling latency in the literature up to August 2014, as well as their merits. A goal of this work is to be able to quantify and compare the merits of the different Internet latency reducing techniques, contrasting their gains in delay reduction versus the pain required to implement and deploy them. We found that classifying techniques according to the sources of delay they alleviate provided the best insight into the following issues: 1) The structural arrangement of a network, such as placement of servers and suboptimal routes, can contribute significantly to latency; 2) each interaction between communicating endpoints adds a Round Trip Time (RTT) to latency, particularly significant for short flows; 3) in addition to base propagation delay, several sources of delay accumulate along transmission paths, today intermittently dominated by queuing delays; 4) it takes time to sense and use available capacity, with overuse inflicting latency on other flows sharing the capacity; and 5) within end systems, delay sources include operating system buffering, head-of-line blocking, and hardware interaction. No single source of delay dominates in all cases, and many of these sources are spasmodic and highly variable. Solutions addressing these sources often both reduce the overall latency and make it more predictable. },

   abstract = {In a heat pump dishwasher, the dishware and the dishwater constitute the heat sink and a water tank filled with water, which can freeze, the heat source. A simulation model developed and validated earlier was modified and used in a parameter study to determine the lowest total electricity usage for the refrigerants R134a, R290, and R600a with different cylinder volumes of the compressor. The total equivalent warming impact (TEWI) was calculated in three regions with different CO2 eq. emissions from electricity generation, i.e., Sweden, Europe (OECD), and Europe (Non-OECD), for small, medium-sized, and large households. In regions with low CO2 eq. emissions from electricity generation, the total TEWI of a heat pump dishwasher is the lowest with R600a and the highest with R134a, and in regions with high CO2 eq. emissions, the total TEWI is the lowest with R600a and the highest with the conventional electrical element. },

In spite of the complexity of the multiethnic globalized societies that we inhabit, current discourses are marked by what Braidotti terms "an imaginative poverty." Braidotti argues that this poverty must be challenged with new figurations: we need to reinvent ourselves. In line with this, this article displays women's participation in local mobilizations, national politics, social uprisings, and communities of belonging in Cambodia through the lens of figurations. It approaches and deconstructs gendered power relations through the construction of different predictable and unpredictable figurations. Of course, there are countless numbers of figurations, but in this text only a few that are seen as political are discussed. },

Los puntos de partida se encuentran en los conceptos de policy enactment, performatividad y fabricación (Ball, 2003, 2009) en combinación con en el método de análisis de conversación (Have 1999). Los análisis se basan en videograbaciones de una lección acerca de un formulario de autoevaluación. Los análisis de la interacción entre profesora y alumnos muestran el predominio de una postura discursiva común, basada en una supuesta necesidad constante de mejoramiento en el alumno, quien siempre debe estar dispuesto a identificar posibles mejoramientos y a hacerse responsable de ellos. Pero también muestran lo que ocurre cuando esto es desafiado por el accionar de un alumno que rehúsa hacerse responsable de las deficiencias escolares, negándose a formularlas en términos de defectos personales propios o de proponer soluciones al problema. Lo cual produce desplazamientos en la interacción que transforman paulatinamente la definición del problema.  },

The since long dominating view that all projects can be managed using a standardized set of methods and techniques is insufficient, since the most apparent feature of projects is that each project is unique. Several attempts have been made to develop typologies for diagnosing projects. The process perspective, based on a rationalistic standpoint, has long been the prevailing perspective in both project practice and project research. This perspective has since the mid ninetieth been challenged by an organizational perspective. We argue that the “result perspective�?, a trivialized perspective within the project research field, can be utilized to increase the understanding of the project phenomenon, and to identify distinctive characteristics in projects. Partly conceptual, and partly based on findings from case studies in three multi project environments carried out during a doctoral study 2004-2009, we describe a framework for a Structured Project Analysis (SPA) based on variations in project deliverables, goals and effects. Three analysis models are outlined: 1) Operational logics - based on variations in the character of the deliverables. 2) Strategic archetypes - based on variations in the project goal and effects. 3) Complexity - based on the nature of complexity in the project deliverables, goal and effects.},

Background: The Family Senseof Coherence scale measures the global sense of coherence in families and might helphealth professionals to identify vulnerable families and to facilitate the strengtheningof coping strategies in families. Design: Cross-sectional. Methods: In total, 264 parentsof children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and 157parents of children in secondary schools in three municipalities responded to a questionnaireregarding the characteristics of the parent and the child, with four scales:Family Sense of Coherence, Sense of Coherence, Family Assessment Device andWell-being. Statistics with Cronbach alpha, intra-class correlation coefficient, independentsample t-test and Pearson’s correlation coefficient were used to establish thereliability and validity of the scale. Results: Internal consistency with Cronbach’s alphawas acceptable and test-retest reliability with intra-class correlation coefficientwas sufficient. Known-groups test revealed statistical differences between the twogroups of parents as pre-considered and significant correlations between FamilySense of Coherence and Sense of Coherence, Family Assessment Device andWell-being were found. Conclusion: The Norwegian version of Family Sense of Coherencescale can be considered as reliable and valid for the studied population. Relevanceto Clinical Practice: The Family Sense of Coherence scale appears to be anappropriate instrument for evaluating and assessing to find vulnerable families whoare in need of interventions strengthening the family’s resources. },

The point of departure is the work and oeuvre of K.E. Bugge, for many years – and remaining until now – the last professor of Religious Education in Denmark, namely at the Royal Danish School of Education (Danmarks Lærerhøjskole) which reorganized as Danish University of Education in 2000. The article situates his doctoral dissertation "The school for life. Studies concerning the pedagogical ideas of N. F. S. Grundtvig" (1965) in its institutional context and compares the forms of knowledge it produced with three PhD dissertations defended during the 2000s and thus in a changed institutional field. Drawing on the conceptual understanding of the field of educational sciences deriving from Hofstetter and Schneuwly (2002), the article analyzes ways of doing research in and related to Religious Education and the scholarly disciplines involved. Focus will be on the relation between the academic disciplines studying religion and the educational sciences in their many disciplinary forms and on the relation between the field of sciences and the field of educational practice. },

   abstract = {This article is a report of the fourth meeting of the Harmonising Outcome Measures for Eczema (HOME) initiative held in Malmo, Sweden on 23-24 April 2015 (HOME IV). The aim of the meeting was to achieve consensus over the preferred outcome instruments for measuring patient-reported symptoms and quality of life for the HOME core outcome set for atopic eczema (AE). Following presentations, which included data from systematic reviews, consensus discussions were held in a mixture of whole group and small group discussions. Small groups were allocated a priori to ensure representation of different stakeholders and countries. Decisions were voted on using electronic keypads. For the patient-reported symptoms, the group agreed by vote that itch, sleep loss, dryness, redness/inflamed skin and irritated skin were all considered essential aspects of AE symptoms. Many instruments for capturing patient-reported symptoms were discussed [ including the Patient-Oriented SCOring Atopic Dermatitis index, Patient-Oriented Eczema Measure (POEM), Self-Administered Eczema Area and Severity Index, Itch Severity Scale, Atopic Dermatitis Quickscore and the Nottingham Eczema Severity Score] and, by consensus, POEM was selected as the preferred instrument to measure patient-reported symptoms. Further work is needed to determine the reliability and measurement error of POEM. Further work is also required to establish the importance of pain/soreness and the importance of collecting information regarding the intensity of symptoms in addition to their frequency. Much of the discussion on quality of life concerned the Dermatology Life Quality Index and Quality of Life Index for Atopic Dermatitis; however, consensus on a preferred instrument for measuring this domain could not be reached. In summary, POEM is recommended as the HOME core outcome instrument for measuring AE symptoms. },

   abstract = {In this paper, we investigate to what degree young adults live in neighbourhoods that are similar, in terms of relative average household income, to the neighbourhoods in which they grew up. We use regression analysis on register data for all individuals who were born in 1974 and lived in metropolitan Sweden in both 1990 and 2006. During this period, the distribution of income in Sweden became far more unequal, unemployment rose dramatically, earlier housing policies were dismantled, the share of ‘visible minorities’ increased dramatically, and residential segregation increased very considerably. We find a correlation between average neighbourhood incomes at these two points in the sample's life cycle of 0.44, which is more than three times as high as the household income correlation. We also find that half of the children of ‘visible minorities’ grew up in the poorer quartile of neighbourhoods, and of these, almost two-thirds remained in the poorest quartile of neighbourhoods as adults. Several measures indicate that intergenerational persistency in context is lower in metropolitan Sweden than was found in a similar study in the US. However, it appears that if visible minority individuals lived in a neighbourhood in the lowest part of the distribution in Sweden as a child, the probability that they will do so also as adults is as high as the corresponding probability for an African-American person in the US. },

   abstract = {This paper offers a new interpretation of the resistance' carried out by local civil society organisations in Cambodia against intimate partner violence (IPV). In this, the paper explores the nexus between rupture', resistance' and repetition' and concludes that different repetitions' can contribute to acts of violence while simultaneously creating possibilities for resisting IPV. In regard to the latter, the concept of rupture' is investigated as a performative politics through which organisations try to disrupt the repetitions' of violent masculinities. Furthermore, it is argued that the importance of repetitions' and the concept of time should be acknowledged. The French criminal defence lawyer Jacques Verges' understanding of rupture' and the French philosopher Gilles Deleuze's notions of repetition' inform the analysis. To exemplify our discussion and findings, the paper embraces stories of a number of civil society workers who facilitate various men's groups in Cambodia in order to negotiate the practice of IPV. },

With religion being a central moral negotiation ground in society, moral debate in society (and not only religious subject matter), and its constitutional role for Religious Education as a research field can explain further diversity of approaches to research in Religious Education.

   abstract = {Increased energy efficiency is a major concern for all companies today. Not only does the cost efficiency follow energy efficiency but also environmental and sustainability aspects motivate more energy efficient production lines. A study has been made on a pilot paper machine with the purpose to show the magnitude and time of rewetting after high vacuum suction box dewatering. The grammages used in this study were 20 and 100 g/m2 to cover both tissue and printing paper grades. Machine speed was varied from 400 to 1600 m/min and the maximum pressure drop in the suction box was 32 kPa. The pulp used was unbeaten, chemical, fully bleached softwood from Sweden. Rewetting is observed when the dewatering in the suction box is sufficiently high. No rewetting takes place when the dewatering in the suction box is limited due to insufficient pressure drop and dwell time. The time for the rewetting is in the range of 10-50 ms and in this study the maximum rewetting observed is 180 g/m2, or 6.1% decrease in dryness. The mechanisms behind the phenomenon are believed to be capillary forces caused by sufficiently low sheet moisture and expansion of the network. This study shows that rewetting is so fast that it would be difficult to prevent it without changing major machine parameters. },

   abstract = {Tillförlitlighet i bedömning är en avgörande komponent i varje testprogram där testtagares resultat bygger på bedömares tolkningar utifrån en bedömningsskala eller en bedömningsguide. Utförliga svar på öppna uppgifter bedöms exempelvis sällan som antingen �?rätt�? eller �?fel�?. Istället tillämpas skalan eller bedömningsguiden för att fastställa i vilken utsträckning svaret uppvisar den efterfrågade kompetensen. I den här artikeln redovisas resultat från en studie av bedömarreliabilitet på öppna uppgifter i det nationella provets svenska läsförståelsedel i årskurs nio. För att undersöka i vilken mån provsystemet skapar förutsättningar för god bedömarreliabilitet har sex lärare fått bedöma tre elevers lösningar av 14 öppna uppgifter, totalt 252 bedömningar. Analyserna innefattar konsensusestimat (procentuell samstämmighet och Cohens kappa) och konsistensestimat (ICC). Dessutom har kvalitativa analyser genomförts på uppgiftsnivå för att visa på aspekter i uppgiftskonstruktionen som kan ligga till grund för låg bedömarreliabilitet. Resultaten från studien visar på moderata nivåer av bedömarreliabilitet, både ifråga om kappavärden (.73) och ICC (.82), vilket motsvarar en variation mellan bedömningarna som får stora konsekvenser för elevernas slutgiltiga provresultat. I artikeln diskuterar vi resultatens implikationer för rättvis bedömning av elevers läsförmåga i Sverige. Vi för också ett resonemang om olika sätt att stärka bedömarreliabiliteten det nationella provet i läsförståelse. },

   abstract = {The emergence of two new technologies, namely Software Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV) have radically changed the development of network functions and the evolution of network architectures. These two technologies bring to mobile operators the promises of reducing costs, enhancing network flexibility and scalability, and shortening the time-to-market of new applications and services. With the advent of SDN and NFV and their offered benefits, the mobile operators are gradually changing the way how they architect their mobile networks to cope with ever-increasing growth of data traffic, massive number of new devices and network accesses, and to pave the way towards the upcoming fifth generation (5G) networking. This paper aims at providing a comprehensive survey of state-of-the-art research work, which leverages SDN and NFV into the most recent mobile packet core network architecture, Evolved Packet Core (EPC). The research work is categorized into smaller groups according to a proposed four-dimensional taxonomy reflecting the (1) architectural ap- proach, (2) technology adoption, (3) functional implementation, and (4) deployment strategy. Thereafter, the research work is exhaustively compared based on the proposed taxonomy and some added attributes and criteria. Finally, the paper identifies and discusses some major challenges and open issues such as scalability and reliability, optimal resource scheduling and allocation, management and orchestration, network sharing and slicing that raise from the taxonomy and comparison tables that need to be further investigated and explored.  },

   abstract = {This study examines the effects of season and weather on mood (valence and activation) and travel satisfaction (measured by the Satisfaction with Travel Scale). Analyses are presented of 562 time-sampled morning commutes to work made by 363 randomly sampled people in three different Swedish cities asking them to use smartphones to report their mood in their home before and directly after the commutes. These reports as well as satisfaction with the commute obtained in summer and winter are linked to weather data and analyzed by means of fixed-effects regression analyses. The results reveal main effects of weather (temperature and precipitation) on mood and travel satisfaction (temperature, sunshine, precipitation, and wind speed). The effects of weather on mood and travel satisfaction differ depending on travel mode. Temperature leads to a more positive mood, wind leads to higher activation for public transport users, and sunshine leads to a more negative mood for cyclists and pedestrians. Sunshine and higher temperatures make travel more relaxed although not for cycling and walking, and rain and snow lead to a higher cognitive assessed quality of travel. },

De här problemen har diskuterats livligt, inte minst bland medlemmarna i FALF (Forum för arbetslivsforskning), och har mynnat ut i ett antal debattartiklar i pressen samt skrivelser till departement och forskningsfinansiärer. Den springande punkten har varit, och är fortfarande, att flytta fram positionerna och verkligen vara en forskning vars resultat bidrar till ett bra arbetsliv och samhälle. För att kunna vara en sådan kraft måste den arbetslivsforskning som bedrivs – och sannolikt är av intresse för en bred allmänhet – synliggöras. Ett bra sätt är då att faktiskt publicera resultaten av forskningen även på svenska. },

   abstract = {Sulfite pulping of pine is well-known to be a risky process because problematic lignin conden-sation reactions can occur resulting in poor pulp quality. However, sulfite pulping of pine is interesting of economic reasons as pine wood is cheaper than spruce. Therefore it has become interesting to investigate sulfite pulping again to determine if old data are still valid. Thus sodium bisulfite pulping of pine was carried out to investigate the influence of time, temperature and cooking acid quality. A small comparison of spruce pulping was also included. By using different cooking temperatures the activation energies for delignification and for degradation of cellulose and hemicelluloses could be determined. The results showed no lignin condensation reactions, thus it was not problematic to carry out these pine cooking experiments. It was found that glucomannan had higher activation energy than xylan and the activation energies of these hemicelluloses were lower than the corresponding value for the lignin degradation. It was found that the activation energy for bisulfite pulping of pine was slightly lower than the activation energy for bisulfite pulping of spruce. },

   abstract = {For competitive purposes, manufacturers of household appliances need to produce appliances that use less electricity. One way of doing this for a dishwasher is to add a heat pump system. Previous studies using R134a as refrigerant have shown that the addition of a heat pump can reduce total electricity consumption by about 24%. This paper reports on the use of a capillary tube in a heat pump dishwasher during the transient heating period. Working with an available compressor, the mass of R600a and the length of a 0.9 mm capillary tube were varied in order to find the configuration with the lowest electricity consumption. Three methods of calculating the length of the capillary tube were used to determine five lengths for evaluation. The results show that using a single capillary tube throughout the transient heating period yields similar electricity consumption to a variable expansion device which occurred by switching the capillary tube between two or three different lengths during the heating period. },

   abstract = {AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To explore successful factors to prevent pressure ulcers in hospital settings. BACKGROUND: Pressure ulcer prevalence has been recognised as a quality indicator for both patient safety and quality of care in hospital and community settings. Most pressure ulcer can be prevented if effective measures are implemented and evaluated. The Swedish Association of Local Authorities and Regions initiated nationwide pressure ulcer prevalence studies in 2011. In 2014, after four years of measurement, the prevalence was still unacceptably high on a national level. The mean prevalence of pressure ulcer in the spring of 2014 was 14% in hospital settings with a range from 2·7-36·4%. DESIGN: Qualitative semistructured interviews were conducted. METHODS: A qualitative content analysis, in addition to Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services frameworks, was used in the analysis of the data text. Individual interviews and focus groups were used to create opportunities for both individual responses and group interactions. The study was conducted at six hospitals during the fall of 2014. RESULTS: Three main categories were identified as successful factors to prevent pressure ulcer in hospitals: creating a good organisation, maintaining persistent awareness and realising the benefits for patients. CONCLUSION: The goal for all healthcare personnel must be delivering high-quality, sustainable care to patients. Prevention of pressure ulcer is crucial in this work. It seems to be easier for small hospitals (with a low number of units/beds) to develop and sustain an effective organisation in prevention work. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: The nurse managers' attitude and engagement are crucial to enable the personnel to work actively with pressure ulcer prevention. Strategies are proposed to advance clinical leadership, knowledge, skills and abilities for the crucial implementation of pressure ulcer prevention. },

The modification, RTO Restart (RTOR), allows the transport to restart its retransmission timer using a smaller timeout duration, so that the effective retransmission timeout (RTO) becomes more aggressive in situations where fast retransmit cannot be used. This enables faster loss detection and recovery for connections that are short lived or application limited. },

In the construction of their own working-life biographical narratives, participants attached great importance to the technology with which they worked. The article contends that workers’ relationship with technology can be more nuanced than either the sociology of technology literature or the sociology of work literature accommodates. Adopting the concept of affordances, it is argued that the physical nature of earlier electromechanical technology afforded engineers the opportunity to ‘fix’ things through the skilled application of tools and act as autonomous custodians of ‘living’ machines: factors that were inherent to their occupational identity. However, the change to digital technology denied the affordances to apply hands-on skill and undermined key elements of the engineering occupational identity. Rather than simply reflecting the nostalgic romanticizing of the past, the biographies captured deterioration in the material realities of work. },

   abstract = {Direct metal laser sintering (DMLS) is an additive manufacturing technology used to melt metal powder by high laser power to produce customised parts, light-weight structures, or other complex objects. During DMLS, powder is melted and solidified track-by-track and layer-by-layer; thus, building direction can influence the mechanical properties of DMLS parts. The mechanical properties and microstructure of material produced by DMLS can depend on the powder properties, process parameters, scanning strategy, and building geometry. In this study, the microstructure, tensile properties, and porosity of DMLS Ti6Al4V (ELI) horizontal samples were analysed. Defect analysis by CT scans in pre-strained samples was used to detect the crack formation mechanism during tensile testing of as-built and heat-treated samples. The mechanical properties of the samples before and after stress relieving are discussed.  },

The volume was discovered in Sweden in November 1904, and purchased by Henry Folger in January 1905. This essay traces the Swedish reactions to the discovery and sale through letters, postcards, telegrams, newspaper articles, photographs, and court documents. In the surviving documents, we can see that at stake was the volume’s monetary value. Nevertheless the negotiations to establish this value soon came to involve other issues such as artistic quality, academic and professional prestige, philanthropic importance, and the peace of mind, as well as health, of individuals involved. The essay pays special attention to the activities of Lund University librarian Evald Ljunggren in furthering the sale but also in contributing information to the academic community. },

The study was based on in-depth interviews with seven women, all with between 24 and 30 years of work experience as cabin attendants. The article focuses on the women's working conditions and well-being and the analysis reveals three key aspects-intensification of work, vulnerability, and aging-that affect the cabin attendants' experiences and emotions in relation to the work. It is at the intersection of these three aspects that the cabin attendants' concerns must be understood. The study's findings indicated that positive emotions such as job satisfaction and commitment have diminished because of exploitative and otherwise poor working conditions. Taking the cabin attendants' concerns as its point of departure, the article shows that there is a need to move away from a discussion about emotional labor toward a discussion of working conditions. },

Based on a short review of security models and the development of privacy-enhancing technology, privacy and electronic identities will be discussed as parts of a larger context—an ecosystem of personal information and electronic identities. The article argues for an ecosystem view of personal information and electronic identities, as both personal information and identity information are basic required input for many applications. Therefore, for both application owners and users, a functioning ecosystem of personal information and electronic identification is important. For the future of the Internet, high-quality information and controlled circulation of such information is therefore argued as decisive for the value of future Internet applications. },

We derive the differential structure of the ring of modular forms for the Shimura curve and relate the ring generators to explicit Heun functions for the quadrilateral group. We also show that the Picard–Fuchs equation of the associated family of abelian surfaces has solutions that are modular forms. These results are used to completely describe the exceptional sets of the Heun functions, and we show how to find examples like \[ Hl\left(\frac{27}{2},\frac{7}{36}; \frac{1}{12},\frac{7}{12},\frac{2}{3},\frac{1}{2}; -\frac{96}{25}\right)=\frac{2^{1/2}5^{2/3}}{3^{4/3}}. \] },

This paper investigates the impact of (il)literacy in the home language on the academic, affective, and social development of bilingual/multilingual children and proposes principles that home-language-literacy programs should meet to be effective. It discusses programs that, although designed to develop literacy or second-language proficiency mainly in classroom contexts, could be easily adapted to address the needs of the linguistically and culturally diverse Australian context. We argue that the cost of not investing in successful homelanguage-literacy programs will be higher in the long run than their implementation costs and recommend that Australia should consider supporting grassroots home-language-literacy programs in a push to improve overall literacy outcomes for Australian home-language speakers.

This essay critiques the Centenary Edition of the romance, arguing that it has inadvertently come to perpetuate Septimius's status as a 'failure.'Reconsidering the internal relations between the documents that make up the romance, the essay suggests that the romance, while incomplete, may well have been brought exactly to the point Hawthorne intended it. Far from being the tragic record of a writer losing his authorial skills, the two 'Septimius' manuscripts, taken together, do not reveal but intentionally and cogently dramatize Hawthorne's sense of - and implicit protest against - the failure of romance in the face of the Civil War },

This topic is considered representative of geography teaching in Denmark. In the last ten years Danish primary and lower-secondary schooling has undergone several significant changes, including the introduction of a final multiple-choice exam in geography in 2007, and a fundamental reconstruction of the curriculum in 2014. These changes are expected to influence the TSPK of geography teachers in ways that potentially have an impact on their classroom practice. Teachers´ responses to specific questions relating to their choice of learning goals and the content and organisation of their lessons show that geography teachers take into account not only the knowledge aspects which point to the final multiple-choice exam, but also the ‘bildung’ perspectives of the subject equipping students to develop their own opinions when dealing with socio-scientific issues (SSI).  },

   abstract = {This article deals with questions about the performative power of cultural products that travel the world. The Japanese manga genre Boys' Love and Yaoi has gained a broad readership outside of Japan during recent decades. This has cultivated an image of Japan as sexually radical and 'as more than Japan', something which has produced alternative subject positions and practises regarding gender and sexuality among Swedish Boys' Love/Yaoi followers. With the help of the concept hyperreality and elaborations on materiality within feminist theories, this article discusses: Which images of Japan and Sweden are produced as manga Boys' Love/Yaoi – as cultural products – travel from Japan to Sweden? Which subject positions and forms of desires emerge? In order to understand how cultural products create new subjectivities, images and desires, we also ask: What can a sharper focus on materiality and the agency of matter add to the understanding of the concept of hyperreality and the construction of new realities? We argue that embodied experiences of certain subject positions and desires challenge the idea of the hyperreal as a surface phenomenon. Further, the article shows how the image of "Japan" is often coloured by the desires that West cultivates about the 'other'. },

Objective. The purpose of this study was to investigate the psychometric properties of the HSCL-10 among adolescents in Norway using Rasch analysis. Methods. The study is based on cross-sectional data from the Norwegian Youth Health Surveys, conducted by the Norwegian Institute of Public Health in 2001 and 2009. The target group comprised of 15- to 16-year olds (Grade 10 students) in Hedmark County, Norway. Ten items with four response categories, intended to measure anxiety and depression, were analysed. The analysis focused on invariance, including differential item functioning (DIF) across genders and years of investigations. In addition, the categorization of the items, targeting, possible multidimensionality and response dependency, was analysed. Results. The HSCL-10 shows good reliability and on the whole, the items work well. However, one item, ‘Sleeping difficulties’, clearly misfit and some items work differently for boys and girls and between years of investigations. There is also need for a better targeting of the scale. Conclusions. The HSCL-10 has the potential to measure the psychological distress among adolescents but there is a room for improvement. Further judgement needs to be made as to whether the misfitting item ‘Sleeping difficulties’ should be removed or retained. },

The purpose of this study was to examine the psychometric properties of the Swedish version of the General Self-Efficacy Scale (GSES) with an adolescent sample, using Rasch analysis. The scale was examined with a focus on invariant functioning along the latent trait as well as across sample groups. The data were collected 2009 and 2010 among 3764 students aged between 13 and 15 years, in the 7th to 9th grade, in compulsory schools in the municipality of Karlstad, Sweden. The item fit was acceptable, the categorization of the items worked well and the scale worked invariantly between years of investigations. Although the GSES worked well as a whole, there was some evidence of misfit indicating room for improvements. The targeting may be improved by adding more questions of medium difficulty. Also, further attention needs to be paid to the dimensionality of the GSES as well as to whether the psychometric properties of GSES are affected by using more recent data. },

   abstract = {Background: Two novel synthetic opioids, MT-45 and AH-7921, with mostly undocumented effects and risks, have emerged on the expanding market for recreational drugs on the Internet. The aim of the present study was to characterize the experiences of AH-7921 and MT-45 as described by the users on international drug discussion forums. Methods: A systematic data search resulted in 96 self-reports which were collected from the leading edge resources of drug related information online. The data were analysed qualitatively using thematic analysis. Results: The experiences of MT-45 and AH-7921 were characterized by the following themes: (1) Administration of the substances, (2) Well-being and energy, (3) Sedation and reduced here-and-now awareness, (4) Tolerance and withdrawal effects, (5) Side effects, (6) Evaluation of the effects, (7) Increased appreciation, sociableness and intimacy and (8) Self-medication. The experiences appeared to include not only the general and expected opioid effects like withdrawal, analgesia, euphoria, cough suppression, fatigue, constipation, itching, involuntary muscle spasm, nausea and pupillary constriction but also a noteworthy increase in energy. Furthermore, the users also experienced reduced inhibition and a facilitation of social situations. The results also showed that users engaged in different forms of self-medicating behaviour aimed at reducing pain or withdrawal symptoms from traditional opioid use. Conclusion: The spread of unpredictable, potent and novel opioids constitutes a public health concern which needs to be further monitored in order to minimize potential harm.  },

   abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore the importance of innovative packaging for marketing purposes in a food supply chain. The intent is also to understand the function of packaging as a marketing tool. The outcome of the study is expected to contribute to the link between packaging and marketing literature. Design/methodology/approach - The case study method was chosen in order to assess and investigate how packaging can be used in marketing. The study focuses on narrating the use of packaging for different customer applications and the unit of analyses was the packaging product. In order to analyse the five sub-cases or "corporate stories" a cross-case analysis was used and the analysis of data was carried out in different stages. This approach treats each sub-case as a separate entity and the analysis reveal both similarities and differences among the sub-cases. Findings - The present study demonstrates that packaging has become an important tool in marketing of different products either this is for end-consumers, or customers in a supply chain. This has become more essential as more products are introduced on a market. The study shows the significance of linking packaging to marketing strategy. An important ingredient for that is the use of packaging design for differentiation purposes. The results support also that packaging has become an essential factor for a secure and efficient distribution in a food supply chain. In addition, packaging and packaging design is contributing to value creation for different actors in a food supply chain. Practical implications - The managerial implication from the case study shows that packaging can be used together with the product concept to create a competitive offering in a market. This gives managers the possibility to differentiate their products from competitive offerings by using packaging and packaging design in a creative manner. Originality/value - This paper fulfils an identified need for contributions to more research on packaging and marketing strategy. The study shows the influence of packaging on marketing. },

Fossil fuels contribute to global warming whilst waste causes the pollution of land, water and air. Alternative fuels and innovative waste management systems are needed to address these issues. In this study a gasification process, fuelled with municipal solid waste, was assumed to be integrated into a heat plant to produce hydrogen, electricity and district heat. A whole system, which includes a gasification reactor, heat plant, steam cycle, pressure swing adsorption, gas turbine and compressors was modelled in Microsoft Excel and an energy balance of the system was solved. Data from the scientific literature were used when setting up the heat and mass balances of the gasification process as well as for assessment of the composition of the syngas. The allocation of energy of the products obtained in the process is 29% hydrogen, 26% electricity and 45% district heat. A significant result of the study is the high energy efficiency (88%) during the cold period of the year when the produced heat in the system is utilized for district heat. The system also shows a competitive energy efficiency (56.5%) all year round. },

The concept is present in all syllabuses, be it with shifting status and position. A discourse analysis of syllabus texts shows how the concept of social issues in some contexts functions as a subject content among other contents, while functioning as a central, organizing principle in others. This analysis also shows how the use of the concept social issues further indicates what educational philosophies and working methods are advocated in the syllabuses. The use of the concept may in turn be interpreted as part of a discursive struggle of powers between advocators of a differentiated upper secondary school model on the one hand and advocators of a unified upper-secondary school model on the other. In this sense, the study of a single concept used in syllabuses may contribute to a discussion about larger educational discourse and the normativity embedded in education in general and in the school subject Samhällskunskap in particular. },

   abstract = {The present paper looks at the issue of standardization in L2 oral testing. Whereas external examiners are frequently used globally, some countries opt for test-takers’ own teachers as examiners instead. In the present study, Sweden is used as a case in point, with a focus on the mandatory, high-stakes, summative, 9th-grade national test in English (speaking part). The national test has the typical characteristics of standardized tests and its main objective is to contribute to equity in assessment and grading on a national level. However, using teachers as examiners raises problems for standardization. The aim of this study is to examine teachers’/examiners’ practices and views regarding four aspects of the speaking test – test-taker grouping, recording practices, the actual test occasion, and examiner participation in students’ test interactions – and to discuss findings in relation to issues concerning the normativity and practical feasibility of standardization, taking the perspectives of test-takers, teachers/examiners, and test constructors into account. In order to answer research questions linked to these four aspects of L2 oral testing, self-report survey data from a random sample of teachers (N = 204) and teacher interviews (N = 11) were collected and quantitative data were analyzed using inferential statistics. Survey findings revealed that despite thorough instructions, teacher practices and views vary greatly across all aspects, which was further confirmed by interview data. Three background variables – teacher certification, work experience, gender – were investigated to see whether they could provide explanations. Whereas certification and gender did not contribute significantly to explaining the findings, work experience bore some relevance, but effect sizes were generally small. The study concludes that using teachers as examiners is a well-functioning procedure in terms of assessment for learning, but raises doubts regarding assessment of learning and standardization; a solution for test authorities could be to frame the test as non-standardized. },

Partial Filling Affinity Capillary Electrophoresis (PF-ACE) combined with Adsorption Energy Distribution (AED) calculations provided information on the heterogeneity of the interactions without any a priori model assumptions. The AED calculations evidenced a homogenous binding site distribution for the interactions. Quartz Crystal Microbalance (QCM) studies were used to evaluate thermodynamics and kinetics of the Low-Density Lipoprotein (LDL) and anti-apoB-100 Mab interactions. High affinity and selectivity were observed, and the emerging data sets were analysed with so called Interaction Maps. In thermodynamic studies, the interaction between LDL and anti-apoB-100 Mab was found to be predominantly enthalpy driven. Both techniques were also used to study antibody interactions with Intermediate-Density (IDL) and Very Low-Density (VLDL) Lipoproteins. By screening affinity constants for IDL-VLDL sample in a single injection we were able to distinguish affinity constants for both subpopulations using the numerical Interaction Map tool. },

Rheological characterization of this system in order to extract structural information for the wet suspension state was accomplished in terms of rotational tests. The analysis, done by Krieger-Dougherty model and the elastic floc model for all flow curves at three different temperatures, 20 degrees C, 25 degrees C and 30 degrees C, and at different particle volume fractions (phi between 0 and 0.31), revealed that the structure of the system changes. Two regions with different behaviour and a plateau region at particle volume fraction of phi similar to 0.16 were observed. At phi &lt;= 0.16 temperature was affecting the suspension structure. By rising the temperature the well dispersed suspension at 20 degrees C transformed to flocculated one, where the higher the temperature was, more open floc structures were detected in terms of degree of flocculation parameter, C-fp, but at the same time with increasing the particle concentration the flocs got denser according to the calculated. At phi &gt;= 0.16, there were not detected major structural differences by changing temperature or particle concentration. At phi similar to 0.16 a plateau in yield stress values was observed. The behaviour of the investigated model coating suspension was discussed in terms of shear stresses and C-fp.  },

The viscoelastic properties of a model coating suspension, consisting of colloidal silica particles, a temperature-responsive triblock copolymer Pluronic F127 and starch were studied and related to the corresponding dried structures. Pluronic F127 was used in order to produce a temperature-sensitive starch system and to simulate the drying of a paper coating at a low shear rates. The gelation process was investigated by the change in storage modulus upon heating and the change in particle volume fraction, empty set. The results revealed a dense disordered liquid-like state at empty set less than or similar to 0.10, where the strength of attraction between particles increased with increasing particle volume fraction and increasing temperature, a solid-like microcrystalline state at empty set greater than or similar to 0.20, where the temperature did not affect the rheology of the system and a solid-like microcrystalline state were coexisting at empty set similar to 0.16. The structures detected by rheology were related to the dried structures of the corresponding suspensions. At empty set less than or similar to 0.10 and elevated temperatures, a controlled formation of self-supporting floc structure was performed, which could be used to promote the even distribution of starch within the composite material.  },

   abstract = {Based on the interdisciplinary experience of a Swedish research committee, this article discusses critical conceptual issues raised by the current debate on mediatization - a concept that holds great potential to constitute a space for synthesized understandings of media-related social transformations. In contrast to other, more metaphorical constructions, mediatization can be studied empirically in systematic ways through various sub-processes that together provide a complex picture of how culture and everyday life evolve in times of media saturation. The first part of this article argues that mediatization researchers have sometimes formulated too grand claims as to mediatization's status as a unitary approach, a meta-theory or a paradigm. Such claims have led to problematic confusions around the concept and should be abandoned in favour of a more open agenda. In line with such a call for openness, the second part of the article introduces historicity, specificity and measurability as three transdisciplinary and transparadigmatic tasks for the contemporary mediatization research agenda. },

We use the first order system form and a staggered grid. The fourth order accuracy in time is obtained by transferring time derivatives in the truncation error to space derivatives. Discontinuous coefficients corresponding to interfaces between different materials are considered as a special case of variable coefficients, and the method is applied across the discontinuities. The accuracy is much improved compared to second order methods even for this type of problem. A certain norm is shown to be conserved, ensuring good accuracy even for long time integration.  },

   abstract = {The article argues for a shift of perspective in identity management (IDM) research and development. Accessibility and usability issues affect identity management to such an extent that they demand a reframing and reformulation of basic designs and requirements of modern identity management systems. The rationale for the traditional design of identity management systems and mechanisms has been security concerns as defined in the field of security engineering. By default the highest security level has been recommended and implemented, often without taking end-user needs and accessibility issues into serious consideration. The article provides a conceptual framework for inclusive IDM, a brief overview of the regulatory status of inclusive IDM and a taxonomy of inclusive identity management methods. Several widespread IDM approaches, methods and techniques are analyzed and discussed from the perspective of inclusive design. Several important challenges are identified and some ideas for solutions addressing the challenges are proposed and discussed. },

The article presents a typology of forecasts, i.e. statements on future events or states. It has two dimensions, truth claim and explanatory claim; each dimension has two values, making the claim or not making the claim. The four outcomes are then: Forecasts which make both truth claims and explanatory claims (predictions); which make truth claims, but not explanatory claims (prognoses); which make explanatory claims, but not truth claims (science fiction); and which make neither truth claims nor explanatory claims (utopias or dystopias). We regard each outcome as an ideal type, against which forecasts can be measured. We illustrate the use of the typology by presenting an example of each outcome },

The data show that the teachers emphasize the body as very important for the learning process, which means that for these children, it is not a matter of simply talking about mathematical concepts, but experiencing them bodily. The teachers also report that they now pay more attention than previously to what material the children use and how they interact with it. They are more aware of how they organize and offer the various materials in the preschool and how this influences the way children use them and, consequently, their learning processes. },

We consider a highly simplified dislocation network, which allows our discrete model to be a one dimensional particle system, in which the interactions between the particles (dislocation walls) are singular and non-local. As a first step towards treating realistic geometries, we focus on finite-size effects rather than considering an infinite domain as typically discussed in the literature. We derive effective equations for the dislocation density by means of Gamma-convergence on the space of probability measures. Our analysis yields a classification of macroscopic models, in which the size of the domain plays a key role. },

The proof of the upscaling procedure (i.e. the discrete-to-continuum passage) relies on the gradient flow structure of both the discrete and continuous energies of dislocations set in a suitable evolutionary variational inequality framework. Moreover, the convexity and Γ-convergence of the respective energies are properties of paramount importance for our arguments. },

   abstract = {Direct metal laser sintering (DMLS) is a relatively new technology that is developing rapidly. Since DMLS material is created by melting/solidifying tracks and layers from powder, even building geometry can influence the mechanical properties. To certify a material, the testing specimens must be designed and manufactured according to the appropriate standards. Miniaturised tensile DMLS samples could be a good alternative for express quality control, and could reduce the cost of DMLS-specific testing. In this study, as-built and stress-relieved miniaturised tensile DMLS Ti6Al4V (ELI) specimens with different surface qualities were investigated. The fracture surfaces and mechanical properties of the mini-tensile specimens were analysed and compared with standard full-sized specimens also manufactured by DMLS. The obtained data showed the applicability of mini-tensile tests for the express analysis of DMLS objects if a correction factor is applied for the calculation of the load-bearing cross-section of the specimen.  },

   abstract = {This is the first major quantitative study of how teachers at the compulsory school look at the subject of History and its conditions. The article focuses on elements of the survey related to the content of teaching and how teachers perceive the conditions for the intercultural mission of the subject. The historical content in the form of selected time periods and geographic focus forms a clear canon: in grades 1–3 local history and Swedish history, in 4–6 Swedish and Nordic history, and in 7–9 Western European history with global, but mainly Eurocentric, outlooks. In terms of students’ skills to interpret history they encounter the result is to some extent contradictory. Empathy and critical thinking are highly valued but the actual work to develop these abilities is of lesser importance. Instead, storytelling is stressed as the major form of education. Teachers in grades 7–9 emphasize that long lines of development are important in their teaching. History’s orienting function leans more to the future and contemporary perspectives in grades 7–9, while students’ perspective on their own historical background ranked highest in 1–3 and 4–6. Future and contemporary issues are highlighted as a pattern in which racism and xenophobia become more important in higher grades while environmental issues decrease in importance. Multiculturalism and diversity issues occupy an intermediate position in this context but are perceived as important by teachers on all levels. An overall conclusion is that in the tension that exists between the traditions of the subject and an external pressure for change teachers need support to deal with the intercultural perspective. },

Besides using energy-like estimates, we cast the special structure of the system in the framework of the Leray–Schauder fixed-point principle and ensure in this way the local existence of strong solutions to a regularized version of our system. Furthermore, weak convergence techniques ensure the existence of weak solutions to the original consolidation problem. The uniqueness of global-in-time solutions is guaranteed in a particular case. Moreover, we use a finite difference scheme to show the negativity of the vector of solutions. },

In a material of tweets containing or responding to explicit comparisons of tweeting to talking (N=520), a broad range of construals are identified, showing Twitter users associating talk-likeness with, e.g., notions of the textual representation of voice, of grammatical (in-)correctness, of accurately reflecting one׳s ‘real-life’ identity, and of regional or social variation in language use. These associations frequently serve normative functions, enforcing or contesting linguistic and discursive norms in both serious and playful ways. The findings offer a novel perspective on the oft-debated orality of computer-mediated discourse, providing a window on how a process of enregisterment (Agha, 2007) is instantiated and how language norms are actively negotiated by participants in everyday online language use on Twitter. },

By elaborating on the shortcomings and the promises of social media based activism and hacktivism, the article discusses the possibility of building alternative online spaces, which can bring these two types of mediatized activism together, and help to connect activists with the rest of the society—especially the otherwise consenting middle classes of semi-authoritarian countries. },

It is argued that they have many similarities, but also differences in the way they address the field and discuss epistemological issues. Theory, method and effects of the dissertations in the research community are mentioned and this leads to a deliberation about the role of academic disciplines in the construction of religious education research. A final discussion concludes that systematic reviews of religious education research would be helpful in order to develop future research and to avoid less fruitful disciplinary rivalries. },

Most of the neologisms in the novel denote corporations and their products and form part of a thoroughgoing critique of consumerism.

However, in the thematic context of the novel, coining practices follow certain patterns and function as effective, if ambiguous, satirical tools. On one level, the practice of branding is thoroughly satirized. On another, however, the neologisms point to both the limitations and possibilities of satire when dealing with the themes addressed in the novel: commoditization, environmental damage on a planetary scale, and a vision of the imminent end of humanity itself. },

This presentation will examine how physical geography topics are justified in specialist teacher magazines in Germany. Are they justified by simply pointing at the value of the academic knowledge itself? Are they justified by claiming students’ special interest in these topics?

Relatively little is known about sheltering by salmonids in response to instream ectothermic predators.We tested the effects of burbot (Lota lota) on the winter sheltering behaviour of PIT-tagged 0+ brown trout (Salmo trutta) in daylight and darkness. Sheltering in the streambed by trout was studied in the presence and absence of fine wood bundles.We found that the use of streambed and fine wood was lower in darkness than in daylight. Availability of fine wood significantly decreased sheltering in the streambed, and this effect was more pronounced in daylight than in darkness. The presence of a burbot significantly decreased sheltering in the streambed, had no effect on use of fine wood and resulted in a higher number of exposed trout.Our results indicate that juvenile brown trout decrease streambed sheltering in response to a burrowing, ectothermic predator. },

The adverse effects on the health and development of the youngest children may be severe. Effective and promising interventions for children who have experienced IPV have been developed and evaluated. However, there is a lack in knowledge about how the children themselves experience the interventions. The aim of this study was to contribute to the evaluation of group treatment designed to improve the psychological health of young children in the aftermath of family violence by elucidating the children's experiences of participating. Nine children, aged 4 to 6 years, were interviewed after participating in group programmes specifically designed for children who have been exposed to intimate partner violence. A semi-structured interview guide with open-ended questions was used. The interviews were transcribed and analysed using interpretative phenomenological analysis, to ensure a focus on the children's own views and experiences. Five master themes embracing the children's experiences were identified: joy - positive emotional experience of participation; security - feeling safe; relatedness - relationships within the group; to talk - externalised focus on the violence; and competence - new knowledge and skills. Theoretical and clinical implications and the benefit of including very young children's views and experiences in research are discussed. },

Focus is put on if and how journalism facilitates democratic processes, encourages civic engagement and strengthens the sense of community. In providing an alternative view, this study mobilizes the cultural sociology of Pierre Bourdieu – a “sociologist of conflict�? – in order to study how young people’s conditions of existence have given rise to vastly different orientations towards news and the normative order surrounding journalism. Based on focus group interviews with young people in Brazil and Sweden, the study shows that socialization into the world of news in the family and in school generates class-distinctive news orientations. The world of news is a site where social groups draw moral and cultural boundaries against each other. Since different social groups monopolize completely different news practices and preferences, they work to legitimate social differences. As such, the findings challenge common notions of news as creating the “healthy citizen�?, and that news media provide spaces for the practice of civility and citizenship.  },

However, relatively few studies have specifically examined users’ experiences of, and preferences for, child and adolescent mental health care. The current study investigated young service users’ views of outpatient and community mental health clinics in Sweden, based on two data sources. First, focus group interviews were conducted with seven children and adolescents (aged 10–18 years) to explore both positive and negative experiences of mental health care. Second, written suggestions about specific service improvements were obtained from 106 children and adolescents. Qualitative content analysis revealed three overarching themes: ‘Accessibility’, ‘Being heard and seen’ and ‘Usefulness of sessions’. Young people’s recommendations for improving practice included more convenient appointment times, offered in welcoming settings; opportunities to communicate more openly with clinical staff, enabling sensitive discussion of mental health and wider personal issues; and more structured treatments that offer greater credibility and relevance to young people’s mental health and developmental needs. Young people also discussed being compelled by parents and school professionals to engage in treatment. Attending to young people’s preferences must be a priority in order to overcome ambivalence about session attendance, and enhance treatment participation and outcomes. },

   abstract = {In the majority of the research on boys’ and young men’s relation to reading, it is argued that boys and young men read too little, read poorly and in all the wrong ways. However, few studies focus on how boys and young men read the texts they do encounter. In particular, there is a lack of research on young men of workingclass background, whose relationship to reading is stressed as particularly problematic in many studies. In this article, we approach the reader histories of three young working-class men from a life story perspective, on the basis of a broad definition of text and reading, to capture how reading and texts are used in their identity construction. Our analysis shows that the young men engage in reading in different ways, from listening to audio books and reading aloud to watching films. We argue that our approach makes it possible to re-envision working-class men as readers who, among other things, use reading to construct softer masculinities, thus challenging the dominant narrative of workingclass masculinity and working-class men’s relationship to reading and texts. },
